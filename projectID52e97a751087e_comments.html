<HTML><BODY><p>This work from 1909 thoroughly criticizes the bible, showing that much of the contemporary critiques have been around for far longer. Note that many of the examples taken from science can be updated to reflect the modern state of science (which we will NOT do here), but the general gist is still valid.

<p>Again, this book has countless references to the scriptures, which I will try to link to actual locations in the bible. Proofers here can vote: To the huge multilingual "<a href="http://www.biblegateway.com">Bible Gateway</a>" site, or to the (more in tone with this work) <a href="http://skepticsannotatedbible.com/">Skeptics Annotated Bible</a>.
