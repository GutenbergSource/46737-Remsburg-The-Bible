<p class="first"><b>The Bible.</b> A new book about the Bible. The best
one of all. Large 12mo. 500 pages. Cloth, $1.25. Postpaid.</p>
<p><b><a class="pglink xd26e45" title="Link to Project Gutenberg ebook"
href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/38378">Christian
Sabbath</a>.</b> A small and valuable tract for promiscuous
distribution wherever the Sunday bigots are enforcing their Sunday
Laws. 3 cents.</p>
<p><b>Decline of Faith.</b> 5 cents.</p>
<p><b>False Claims of the Church.</b> Analyzing and confuting the
claims made by churchmen that the Christian church has promoted
morality, learning, temperance, science, freedom, and showing how she
has opposed progress. Paper, 10 cents.</p>
<p><b>Image Breaker.</b> 25 cents.</p>
<p><b>Paine and Wesley.</b> 5 cents.</p>
<p><b>Piety and the Slave Trade.</b> The Record of Methodism. (Tract.)
5 cents.</p>
<p><b>Prophets and Prophecies.</b> Future Events Not Predicted.
(Tract.) 3 cents.</p>
<p><b>Protestant Intolerance.</b> (Tract.) 5 cents.</p>
<p><b>Sabbath Breaking.</b> Giving the origin of Sabbath ideas,
examining Sunday arguments, and showing that there is no scriptural
authority for the observance of the day: also showing that the
Christian &ldquo;Fathers&rdquo; did not specially regard the day and
that the Reformers opposed its adoption by the church. A book brimful
of good reasons why the Sunday laws should be repealed. Paper, 25
cents.</p>
<p><b>Six Historic Americans.</b> This work consists of two parts,
<span class="corr" id="xd26e164" title=
"Source: &lsquo;">&ldquo;</span><i>The Fathers of the
Republic</i>,&rdquo; and &ldquo;<i>The Saviors of Our
Republic</i>.&rdquo; In regard to Paine&rsquo;s religious views, Mr.
Remsburg establishes the negative of the following: (1) Was Paine an
Atheist? (2) Was he a Christian? (3) Did he recant? Page after page of
the most radical Freethought sentiments are culled from the
correspondence and other writings of Franklin and Jefferson, which show
that these men were as pronounced in their rejection of Christianity as
Paine and Ingersoll. That Washington was not a church communicant, nor
even a believer in Christianity, is affirmed or admitted by more than a
score of witnesses, one-half of them eminent clergymen, including the
pastors of the churches, which he with his wife attended. In support of
Lincoln&rsquo;s Infidelity, he has collected the testimony of more than
one hundred witnesses. These witnesses include Mr. Lincoln&rsquo;s
wife; his three law partners, Maj. Stuart, Judge Logan and W. H.
Herndon; his private secretaries. Col. Nicolay and Col. Hay; his
executor after death, Judge David Davis; many of his biographers,
including his companion and confidant, Col. Lamon; his political
advisers, Col. Matheny, Jesse W. Fell, and Dr. Jayne; members of his
cabinet, and scores more of his most intimate friends and associates.
The refutation of Grant&rsquo;s alleged Christian belief is complete,
and the proofs of his unbelief are full and convincing. Large 12mo.

<h2 class="main">PREFACE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In January, 1901, the following announcement appeared
in The Truth Seeker, of New York:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first"><span class="sc">To the Readers of The Truth
Seeker</span>: Two years ago that able and sagacious Liberal leader, L.
K. Washburn, wrote: &ldquo;The next great moral revolution of the world
will be a crusade against the Christian Bible.&rdquo; The church
expects this and is preparing for it. In an address before the
Methodist ministers of Chicago, the Rev. Dr. Curry, a distinguished
Methodist divine, said: &ldquo;We are standing on the eve of the most
stupendous revolution in reference to the doctrines of the Bible that
the church has ever known.&rdquo; In this long war with bibliolaters
the younger readers of The Truth Seeker will take a prominent part. To
call their attention to the impending struggle, and to aid in a small
way in fitting them for it, the editor of The Truth Seeker has invited
me to open a sort of Bible school in his paper. For nearly a quarter of
a century I have been writing and lecturing and debating against the
divinity of the Bible. My opposition from the trained defenders
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e243" href="#xd26e243" name=
"xd26e243">vi</a>]</span>of the book has been at times both keen and
bitter. I was compelled to become and remain a diligent student of the
Bible and of Biblical criticism. As far as possible I collected all of
the damaging facts obtainable. I digested and classified them and filed
them away in the labeled pigeon-holes of my brain for use when needed.
I am growing old. My hair which was black when I began my work will
soon be white. I have at the most but a few more years to labor. This
arsenal of facts which I have gathered and the arguments that I have
formulated from them I wish to place within the reach of others.
Whether the thought be a Spiritualistic assurance or an Irish bull, it
will be a pleasure to me when I am dead to know that I am still of some
service to the cause.</p>
<p>In the next issue of The Truth Seeker I shall begin a series of some
thirty lessons or chapters on &ldquo;The Bible.&rdquo; The chief
purpose of the work will be to combat the dogmas of the divine origin
and infallibility of the Christian Bible. The points of attack will be
three: 1. Its Authenticity; 2. Its Credibility; 3. Its Morality. I
shall endeavor to disprove in a large degree the authenticity of its
books, the credibility of its statements, and the morality of its
teachings.</p>
<p class="signed"><span class="sc">John E. Remsburg.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>These chapters were published in weekly installments in The Truth
Seeker, their publication extending through a period of twenty
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="xd26e253" href="#xd26e253" name=
"xd26e253">vii</a>]</span>months. The matter was electrotyped as
published and the work will now be given to the public in book form. To
those interested in Biblical criticism, and especially to the
Freethought propagandist and to the Christian investigator, it is hoped
that its contents may be useful.</p>
<p>The facts presented in this volume, while known to many Christian
scholars, are, as far as possible, kept from the lower orders of the
clergy and from the laity. Divines enjoying high honors and large
salaries may be cognizant of them without endangering their faith; but
the humbler ministers who receive small pay, and the laity who support
the church, are liable to have their faith impaired by a knowledge of
them.</p>
<p>In Part II., devoted to the Credibility of the Bible, less space is
given to the errors of the New Testament than to those of the Old
Testament. This is not because the New contains less errors than the
Old, but because the author has prepared another volume on this
subject. In &ldquo;The Christ,&rdquo; a sequel to &ldquo;The
Bible,&rdquo; a more exhaustive exposition of the errors of the New
Testament, particularly of the Four Gospels, is given.</p>
<p>While denying the infallibility of the writers of the Bible the
author is not unconscious of his own fallibility. <span class=

<h2 class="main">SACRED BOOKS OF THE WORLD.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Asia has been the fruitful source of religions and
Bibles. The seven great religions of the world, Brahmanism, Buddhism,
Confucianism, Zoroastrianism, Mohammedanism, Judaism, and
Christianity&mdash;all had their birth in Asia; and the so-called
sacred books which are used to uphold and propagate these faiths were
nearly all written by Asiatic priests and prophets. A brief description
of the most important of these books will be presented in this
chapter.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Sacred Books of India.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Vedas.</span>&mdash;The Vedas are the
oldest Bibles in the world. There are four of them, the Rigveda, the
Yajurveda, the Samaveda, and the Atharvaveda. Devout Hindoos believe
that these books have always existed&mdash;that they <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb6" href="#pb6" name="pb6">6</a>]</span>are
co-eternal with God. Scholars agree that they are very old, that the
Rigveda, the oldest of the four, and one of the oldest books extant,
was composed between 3,000 and 4,000 years ago. Each Veda is complete
in itself, and consists of religious teachings, prayers, and hymns.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Puranas.</span>&mdash;The Vedas and Puranas are the
most important of the sacred books of the Hindoos. The Puranas, more
than any other works, have contributed to mould the doctrines of the
popular Brahmanical religion of India. They are eighteen in number, of
which the Bhagavata, containing a history of Chrisna, is the one best
known.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tripitaka.</span>&mdash;This is the Buddhist Bible.
It was compiled 300 years before the Christian era. Self conquest and
universal charity are its fundamental teachings.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Upanishads.</span>&mdash;These are sacred books
which treat of the Creation, of the Supreme Being or Spirit, Brahma,
and of the nature of the human soul and its relation to Brahma.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tantras.</span>&mdash;The Tantras are sacred books
relating chiefly to the God Siva.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Ramayana.</span>&mdash;The Ramayana is one of the
great epic poems of the world. It gives the history of Rama, one of the
incarnations of the God Vishnu.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Mahabharata.</span>&mdash;This is another epic
poem, a larger one, containing more than 100,000 verses. Like the
Ramayana, it is believed to be of divine origin. It has been described
as &ldquo;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb7" href="#pb7" name=
"pb7">7</a>]</span>great manual of all that is moral, useful, and
agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="sc">Institutes of Menu.</span>&mdash;Menu is regarded
as the law-giver of the Hindoos, as Moses is of the Jews. The
Institutes of Menu are in many respects similar to the so-called laws
of Moses.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Sacred Books of China.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Yih King.</span>&mdash;This book
contains a cosmological treatise and a compendium on morals. It was
written 1143 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Shu King.</span>&mdash;This contains the teachings
and maxims of certain ancient Chinese kings. There are documents in it
over 4,000 years old.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Shi King.</span>&mdash;This is the Chinese hymn
book. It contains three hundred sacred songs and poems, some of which
are very old.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Le King.</span>&mdash;The Le King is a text book on
manners, customs, and ceremonies. It has been one of the chief agents
in moulding the social and religious life of China.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Chun Tsien.</span>&mdash;The Chun Tsien is a
historical work compiled by Confucius. It gives a record of his own
times and those immediately preceding him.</p>
<p>The above books, called the Five Kings, are the canonical books of
Confucianism, the religion of the educated classes of China. With the
exceptions noted, they were mostly written or compiled about 500
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> They are considered sacred by the Chinese,
but not, like other sacred books, a revelation from God. Confucius
recognized <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb8" href="#pb8" name=
"pb8">8</a>]</span>no God. His religion is preeminently the religion of
this world, and is thus summed up by him: &ldquo;The observance of the
three fundamental laws of relation between sovereign and subject,
father and child, husband and wife, and the five capital
virtues&mdash;universal charity, impartial justice, conformity to
ceremonies and established usages, rectitude of heart and mind, and
pure sincerity.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Sacred Books of Persia.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Zend Avesta.</span>&mdash;This is one
of the most important of all the Bibles of the world, although the
religion which it teaches numbers but a few adherents. It was written
by Zoroaster and his disciples about 3,000 years ago. It was an
enormous work in size, covering, it is said, 12,000 parchments. The
Zend Avesta proper consisted of twenty-one books. All of these, save
one and some fragments of the others, have perished. They dealt chiefly
with religion, but touched upon almost every subject of interest to
mankind. They were believed to be a faithful record of the words spoken
to the great prophet by God himself. Both Jews and Christians borrowed
much from the Zend Avesta.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sadder.</span>&mdash;The Sadder is the Bible of the
modern Parsees, and contains, in an abridged form, the religious
teachings of Zoroaster.</p>

<p class="first"><i>Koran.</i>&mdash;The Mohammedans believe that
divine revelations were given to Adam, Seth, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb9" href="#pb9" name="pb9">9</a>]</span>Enoch,
Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, and Mohammed, and that each successive
revelation in a measure superseded the preceding one. The books given
to Adam, Seth, Enoch, and Abraham have been lost. The Pentateuch, the
Psalms, and the Four Gospels are accepted by them, but the
interpolations and corruptions of Jews and Christians, they claim, have
greatly impaired their value. The Koran is with them the book of
books&mdash;God&rsquo;s last and best revelation to man. It was written
in rays of light on a tablet before the throne of God. A copy bound in
white silk and bedecked with gems was carried by Gabriel to the lowest
heaven, where from time to time, during a period of twenty years,
portions of it were transmitted to Mohammed until the whole was given
to the world. The book is divided into 114 chapters. It is elegant in
style, and, like most other Bibles, contains, along with a great deal
that is fabulous and puerile, some admirable moral teachings.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sunna.</span>&mdash;The Sunna is a large work
containing many thousand legends of Mohammed. It is a sacred book, but
of less authority than the Koran.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Torah.</span>&mdash;The Book of the
Law, now commonly called the Pentateuch, is the most sacred of all
Jewish books. Jews as well as Christians believe that it was written by

<p><span class="sc">Talmud.</span>&mdash;The Talmud, while not regarded

<p class="first"><span class="sc">Holy Bible.</span>&mdash;The
Christian Bible consists of two collections of small books, one called
the Old Testament, the other the New Testament. The Old Testament
comprises the Torah, Nebiim, and Cethubim of the Jews. It is divided
into 39 books (including the Apocryphal books accepted by the Greek and
Roman Catholic churches, about 50). The New Testament is a collection
of 27 early Christian writings, which originally appeared in the
various churches of Asia, Africa and Europe.</p>

Christians deny the divinity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb11" href=

affirm that they are of human origin&mdash;that their book is

its divinity is expressed in the following words:</p>

controlling, guiding, and suggesting every part of their different

<p>The books of the Old Testament were called The Scripture, or
Scriptures, by early Christians. After the books of the New Testament
were recognized as canonical and inspired, the terms Old and New
Testaments were employed to distinguish the two divisions. Tertullian,
at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb14" href="#pb14" name=
"pb14">14</a>]</span>the beginning of the third century, was the first
to use the term New Testament.</p>
<p>The proper arrangement of the books of the Old Testament is in the
order named in the foregoing list. Both Jews and Christians, however,
have varied the order. The books of the Hagiographa, with the
exceptions of Ruth which follows Judges, Lamentations which follows
Jeremiah, and Daniel which appears among the Prophets, have been placed
between the Earlier and Later Prophets. In later Jewish versions the
Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, and Esther, called
the five rolls, come immediately after the Pentateuch. In the Christian
Bibles of the Eastern churches, including the two most noted ancient
manuscripts, the Vatican and Alexandrian, the seven Catholic Epistles,
James, 1 Peter, 2 Peter, 1 John, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude, follow Acts
and precede the Pauline Epistles.</p>
<p>In the accepted Hebrew the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament
formed but twenty-two, corresponding to the twenty-two letters of the
Hebrew alphabet. Judges and Ruth formed one book, First and Second
Samuel one, First and Second Kings one, First and Second Chronicles
one, Ezra and Nehemiah one, Jeremiah and Lamentations one, and the
twelve Minor Prophets one.</p>
<p>The books of the Pentateuch (<i>Pente</i>, five; <i>teuchos</i>,
volume) now bear the Greek names given them by the Septuagint
translators, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb15" href="#pb15"
name="pb15">15</a>]</span>the exception of the fourth, Arithmoi, which
is called by the English name, Numbers. The Hebrew names for these, as
well as many other books of the Old Testament, are the initial words of
the books. The name of Genesis, as translated, is &ldquo;In the
Beginning;&rdquo; Exodus, &ldquo;These Are the Words;&rdquo; Leviticus,
&ldquo;And He Called;&rdquo; Numbers, &ldquo;And He Spake;&rdquo;
Deuteronomy, &ldquo;These Are the Words.&rdquo; Joshua originally
belonged to this collection, and to the six books modern scholars have
given the name Hexateuch.</p>
<p>About one-half of the books of the Bible, Joshua, Isaiah, Matthew,
etc., are named after their alleged authors. A few, like Ruth and
Esther, take their names from the leading characters of the books. The
Pauline Epistles bear the names of the churches, people, or persons to
whom they are addressed. The titles of Judges, Kings, Chronicles,
Psalms, Proverbs, and a few others, indicate the subjects of the
books.</p>
<p>The division of the books of the Bible into chapters was made in the
thirteenth century; the division into verses, in the sixteenth century.
These divisions are to a great extent mechanical rather than logical.
Paragraphs are frequently divided in the formation of chapters, and
sentences in the formation of verses.</p>

apocryphal books of the Old and New Testaments. Of these two hundred
and fifty Jewish and Christian writings, sixty-six&mdash;about
one-fourth&mdash;have been declared canonical and divine by
Protestants.</p>
<p>In the mind of the devout Protestant there is as great a difference
between the canonical and apocryphal books of the Old and New
Testaments as there is between light and darkness. The former he
regards as the work of a wise and good God, the latter, with a few
exceptions, as the work of ignorant and wicked men. And yet there is no
such difference. The two classes are of much the same character. The
worst canonical books are, perhaps, better than the worst apocryphal
books; while, on the other hand, the best apocryphal books, if not
equal to the best canonical books, are far superior to a majority of
them. Circumstances rather than merit determined the fate of these
books. Books of real merit and of high authority in some of the early
churches were cast aside because these churches either ceased to exist
or changed their creeds; while books of little merit survived as
authorities because their teachings supported the doctrines which
survived. The religion of the primitive churches underwent many radical
changes. The Christianity of the second century was not the
Christianity of the first. Books teaching the new theology superseded
those which taught the old; and thus the <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb20" href="#pb20" name="pb20">20</a>]</span>earlier writings became
obsolete. Of all the Christian books written prior to the middle of the
second century only a few epistles have been retained as authorities.

<h2 class="main">FORMATION OF THE CANON.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Second in interest and importance only to the origin
of the individual books composing the Bible are the facts relating to
the manner in which these books were collected into one great volume
and declared canonical or authoritative. The formation of the canon
required centuries of time to complete.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Jewish Canon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Jewish canon, it is claimed, was chiefly the work
of Ezra, completed by Nehemiah. &ldquo;All antiquity,&rdquo; says Dr.
Adam Clarke, &ldquo;is nearly unanimous in giving Ezra the honor of
collecting the different writings of Moses and the prophets and
reducing them into the form in which they are now found in the
Bible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This opinion, shared alike by Jews and Christians, is simply a
tradition. There is no conclusive evidence that Ezra founded the canon
of the Old Testament. Nehemiah could not have completed it, because a
part of the books were written after his time. There is no proof that
all the books of the Old Testament existed in a <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb22" href="#pb22" name=
"pb22">22</a>]</span>collected form before the beginning of the
Christian era. There is no proof that even the Law and the Prophets
existed in such a form before the Maccabean period. The Rev. Frederick
Myers, an able authority on the Bible, makes this candid admission:
&ldquo;By whom the books of the Old Testament were collected into one
volume, and by what authority made canonical, we do not know&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Catholic Thoughts on the Bible,&rdquo; p. 56).</p>
<p>Another prevalent belief is that all of the Jewish scriptures were
lost during the captivity, and that Ezra was divinely inspired to
rewrite them. Iren&aelig;us says: &ldquo;God &hellip; inspired Esdras,
the priest of the tribe of Levi, to compose anew all the discourses of
the ancient prophets, and to restore to the people the laws given them
by Moses&rdquo; (&ldquo;Ecclesiastical History,&rdquo; Book V., chap.
viii).</p>
<p>This is a myth. The books of the Old Testament which were written
before the captivity were not lost. Many books, it is true, were
written after the captivity, but these books were not reproductions of
lost writings. They were original compositions, or compilations of
documents which had not been lost.</p>
<p>If Ezra was inspired, as claimed, to rewrite the Hebrew scriptures,
he did not complete his task, for the books that were really lost have
never been restored, and the Old Testament is but a part of the Hebrew
scriptures that once existed. St. Chrysostom says: &ldquo;The Jews
having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb23" href="#pb23" name=
"pb23">23</a>]</span>been at some time careless, and at others profane,
they suffered some of the sacred books to be lost through their
carelessness, and have burnt and destroyed others.&rdquo; The list of
books given in the preceding chapter, under the head of &ldquo;Lost
Books cited by writers of the Bible,&rdquo; would nearly all be deemed
canonical were they extant. Referring to these books, the Rev. Dr.
Campbell, in his &ldquo;Introduction to Matthew,&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;The Book of the Wars of the Lord, the Book of Jasher, the Book
of Nathan the Prophet, the Book of Gad the Seer, and several others,
are referred to in the Old Testament, manifestly as of equal authority
with the book which refers to them, and as fuller in point of
information. Yet these are to all appearances irrecoverably
lost.&rdquo; God&rsquo;s revelation in its entirety, then, no longer
exists.</p>
<p>The ten Hebrew tribes which formed the kingdom of Israel, and whose
remnants were afterwards called Samaritans, accepted only the first six
books of the Old Testament. The other Jews generally accepted the
Pentateuch and the Prophets, and, in a less degree, the Hagiographa as
canonical. Some of them also attached more or less importance to the
Apocryphal books.</p>

<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Christian Canon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Respecting the formation of the New Testament canon,
the Rev. Dr. Roswell D. Hitchcock says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new book of records was, like the old, set down by
eye-witnesses of and actors in its <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb24"
href="#pb24" name="pb24">24</a>]</span>scenes, closely after their
occurrence; its successive portions were cautiously scrutinized and
clearly distinguished as entitled to reception; when the record,
properly so-called, was completed, the new canon was closed&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Analysis of the Bible,&rdquo; p. 1149).</p>
<p>&ldquo;This process was rapid and decisive; it had in all
probability become substantially complete before the death of John, the
last of the apostles&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 1158).</p>
<p>That these statements, popularly supposed to be true, are wholly
untrue will be demonstrated by the facts presented in this and
succeeding chapters. The Christian canon was not completed before the
death of the last apostle. The New Testament did not exist in the time
of the apostles. It did not exist in the time of the Apostolic Fathers.
It was not in existence in the middle of the second century.</p>
<p>There was no New Testament in the time of Papias. Dr. Samuel
Davidson, the highest Christian authority on the canon, says:
&ldquo;Papias (150 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>) knew nothing, so far
as we can learn, of a New Testament canon&rdquo; (&ldquo;Canon of the
Bible,&rdquo; p. 123).</p>
<p>Justin Martyr knew nothing of a New Testament canon. I quote again
from Dr. Davidson: &ldquo;Justin Martyr&rsquo;s canon (150 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>), so far as divine authority and inspiration are
concerned, was the Old Testament&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 129).</p>
<p>For nearly two centuries after the beginning of the Christian era,
the Old Testament&mdash;the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb25" href=
"#pb25" name="pb25">25</a>]</span>Old Testament alone&mdash;constituted
the Christian canon. No other books were called scripture; no other
books were considered inspired; no other books were deemed
canonical.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Founding of the Canon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">To Iren&aelig;us, more than to any other man, belongs
the credit of founding the Roman Catholic church; and to him also
belongs the credit of founding the New Testament canon, which is a
Roman Catholic work. No collection of books corresponding to our New
Testament existed before the time of Iren&aelig;us. He was the first to
make such a collection, and he was the first to claim inspiration and
divine authority for its books. Dr. Davidson says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conception of canonicity and inspiration attaching to New
Testament books did not exist till the time of Iren&aelig;us&rdquo;
(&ldquo;Canon,&rdquo; p. 163).</p>
<p>At the close of the second century the Christian world was divided
into a hundred different sects. Iren&aelig;us and others conceived the
plan of uniting these sects, or the more orthodox of them, into one
great Catholic church, with Rome at the head; for Rome was at this time
the largest and most influential of all the Christian churches.
&ldquo;It is a matter of necessity,&rdquo; says Iren&aelig;us,
&ldquo;that every church should agree with this church on account of
its preeminent authority&rdquo; (&ldquo;Heresies,&rdquo; Book 3).</p>
<p>In connection with this work Iren&aelig;us made a collection of
books for use in the church. His <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb26"
href="#pb26" name="pb26">26</a>]</span>collection comprised the
following: Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts, Romans, First Corinthians,
Second Corinthians, Galatians<span class="corr" id="xd26e1192" title=
"Not in source">,</span> Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, First
Thessalonians, Second Thessalonians, First Timothy, Second Timothy,
Titus, Philemon, First John, and Revelation&mdash;twenty books in
all.</p>
<p>In the work of establishing the Roman Catholic church and the New
Testament canon Iren&aelig;us was succeeded, early in the third
century, by Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria. They adopted the list
of books made by him. The books adopted by these Fathers were selected
from a large number of Christian writings then extant&mdash;forty or
more gospels, nearly as many Acts of Apostles, a score of Revelations,
and a hundred epistles. Each church had one or more books which were
used in that church. No divine authority, however, was ascribed to any
of them.</p>
<p>Why did the Fathers choose these particular books? Above all, why
did they choose four gospels instead of one? We never see four
biographies of Washington, of Cromwell, or of Napoleon, bound in one
volume; yet here we have four different biographies of Jesus in one
book. Iren&aelig;us says it is because &ldquo;there are four quarters
of the earth in which we live, and four universal winds.&rdquo; Instead
of this artificial reason he could have given a natural, a rational,
and a truthful reason. While primitive Christians, as we have seen,
were divided into many <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb27" href="#pb27"
name="pb27">27</a>]</span>sects, the principal sects may be grouped
into three divisions: 1. The Petrine churches, comprising the church of
Rome and other churches which recognized Peter as the chief of the
apostles and the visible head of the church on earth; 2. The Pauline
sects, which accepted Paul as the true exponent of Christianity; 3. The
Johannine or Eastern churches, which regarded John as their founder. A
collection of books to be acceptable to all of these churches must
contain the favorite books of each. The First Gospel, written about the
time this church union movement was inaugurated, was adopted by the
Petrine churches. The Second Gospel was also highly valued by the
church of Rome. The Third Gospel, a revised and enlarged edition of the
Pauline Gospel of Marcion, had become the standard authority of Pauline
Christians. The Fourth Gospel, which had superseded other and older
gospels, was generally read in the Johannine churches. The Acts of the
Apostles, written for the purpose of healing the dissensions that had
arisen between the followers of Peter and Paul, was acceptable to both
Petrines and Paulines. The Epistles of Paul were of course received by
the Pauline churches, while the First Epistle of John was generally
received by the Eastern churches. The collection would not be complete
without a Revelation, and the Revelation of John was selected.</p>
<p>The work instituted by Iren&aelig;us was successful. The three
divisions of Christendom were <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb28" href=
"#pb28" name="pb28">28</a>]</span>united, and the Catholic church was
established. But this cementing, although it held for centuries, did
not last, as was hoped, for all time. The seams gave way, the divisions
separated, and to-day stand out as distinctly as they did in the second
century; the Roman Catholic church representing the Petrine, the Greek
church the Johannine, and the Protestant churches to a great extent the
Pauline Christians of that early age. But while the church separated,
each retained all of the sixty-six canonical books, save Revelation,
which for a time was rejected by the Greek church.</p>
<p>The New Testament originally contained but twenty books. To First
Peter, Second John, and the Shepherd of Hermas Iren&aelig;us attached
some importance, but did not place them in his canon. Hebrews, James,
Second Peter, Third John, and Jude he ignored. Tertullian placed in an
appendix Hebrews, First Peter, Second John, Jude, and the Shepherd of
Hermas. Clement of Alexandria classed as having inferior authority,
Hebrews, Second John, Jude, First and Second Epistles of Clement (of
Rome), Epistle of Barnabas, Shepherd of Hermas, and Revelation of
Peter.</p>
<p>Regarding the competency of the founders of the New Testament canon,
Davidson says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the three fathers who contributed most to its early
growth, Iren&aelig;us was credulous and blundering, Tertullian
passionate and one-sided, and Clement of Alexandria, imbued with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb29" href="#pb29" name=
"pb29">29</a>]</span>the treasures of Greek wisdom, was mainly occupied
with ecclesiastical ethics&rdquo; (Canon, p. 155).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three Fathers of whom we are speaking had neither the
ability nor the inclination to examine the genesis of documents
surrounded with an apostolic halo. No analysis of their authenticity
was seriously contemplated&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 156).</p>

<h3 class="main">Completion of the Canon.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Christian canon, including the New Testament
canon, assumed something like its present form under the labors of
Augustine and Jerome toward the close of the fourth century. St.
Augustine&rsquo;s canon contained all of the books now contained in the
Old and New Testaments, excepting Lamentations, which was excluded. It
contained, in addition to these, the apocryphal pieces belonging to
Daniel, and the books of Tobit, Judith, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, and
First and Second Maccabees.</p>
<p>St. Jerome&rsquo;s canon contained Lamentations, which
Augustine&rsquo;s canon excluded, and omitted Tobit, Judith, Wisdom,
Ecclesiasticus, and First and Second Maccabees, which Augustine&rsquo;s
included. Roman Catholics accept the canon of Augustine, including
Lamentations; Protestants, generally, accept the canon of Jerome.</p>
<p>While Jerome included in his canon all the books of the New
Testament, he admitted that Philemon, Hebrews, Second Peter, Second and
Third John, Jude, and Revelation were of doubtful authority.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb30" href="#pb30" name=
"pb30">30</a>]</span></p>
<p>Referring to the work of Augustine and Jerome, Davidson, says:
&ldquo;Both were unfitted for the critical examination of such a
topic&rdquo; (Canon, p. 200).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Christian Councils.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Many believe that the Council of Nice, held in 325
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>, determined what books should constitute
the Bible. This council did not determine the canon. So far as is
known, the first church council which acted upon this question was the
Synod of Laodicea which met in 365. This council rejected the
Apocryphal books contained in Augustine&rsquo;s list, but admitted
Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah. It excluded Revelation.</p>
<p>Various councils, following this, adopted canonical lists. One
council would admit certain books and the next council would reject
them. The third council of Carthage in 397 adopted the list of
Augustine which admitted the Apocryphal books and Revelation and
rejected Lamentations.</p>
<p>The actions of none of these councils were unanimous or decisive.
The list of books adopted was adopted simply by a majority vote. A
large minority of every council refused to accept the list of the
majority. Some advocated the admission of books that were rejected;
others opposed the admission of books that were accepted. As late as
the seventh century (629), at the sixth Council of Constantinople,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb31" href="#pb31" name=
"pb31">31</a>]</span>many different canonical lists were presented for
ratification.</p>
<p>The damaging facts that I have adduced concerning the formation of
the Christian canon are admitted in a large degree by one of the most
orthodox of authorities, McClintock and Strong&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Cyclopedia of Biblical and Ecclesiastical Literature.&rdquo; Dr.
McClintock says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The New Testament canon presents a remarkable analogy to the
canon of the Old Testament. The beginnings of both are
obscure&#8202;&hellip;. The history of the canon may be divided into
three periods. The first, extending to 170, includes the era of
circulation and gradual collection of the apostolic writings. The
second is closed in 303, separating the sacred from other
ecclesiastical writings. The third may be defined by the third Council
of Carthage, 397 <span class="sc"><span class="corr" id="xd26e1247"
title="Source: A.C.">A.D.</span></span>, in which a catalogue of the
books of the Scriptures was formally ratified by conciliar authority.
The first is characteristically a period of tradition, the second of
speculation, and the third of authority, and we may trace the features
of the successive ages in the course of the history of the canon. But
however all this may have been, the complete canon of the New
Testament, as we now have it, was ratified by the third Council of
Carthage, 397 <span class="sc"><span class="corr" id="xd26e1251" title=
"Source: A.C.">A.D.</span></span>, from which time it was generally
accepted by the Latin church, some of the books remaining in doubt and
disputed.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb32" href="#pb32" name=
"pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning the work of these councils, William Penn writes as
follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say how do they know that these men discerned true from
spurious? Now, sure it is, that some of the Scriptures taken in by one
council were rejected by another for apocryphal, and that which was
left out by the former for apocryphal was taken in by the latter for
canonical&rdquo; (Penn&rsquo;s Works, Vol. I., p. 302).</p>
<p>In regard to the character of these councils, Dean Milman
writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It might have been supposed that nowhere would Christianity
appear in such commanding majesty as in a council&#8202;&hellip;.
History shows the melancholy reverse. Nowhere is Christianity less
attractive, and if we look to the ordinary tone and character of the
proceedings, less authoritative, than in the councils of the church. It
is in general a fierce collision of two rival factions, neither of
which will yield, each of which is solemnly pledged against
conviction&rdquo; (History of Latin Christianity, Vol. I., p. 226).</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic, Greek Catholic, and Protestant canons, no two of
which are alike, were fixed by modern councils. The Council of Trent
(1545&ndash;1563) determined the Roman Catholic canon. While a majority
were in favor of the canon of Augustine they were not agreed in regard
to the character and classification of the books. There were four
parties. The first advocated two divisions of the books, one to
comprise the acknowledged books, the other the disputed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb33" href="#pb33" name="pb33">33</a>]</span>books.
The second party proposed three divisions&mdash;the acknowledged books,
the disputed books of the New Testament, and the Apocryphal books of
the Old Testament. The third party desired the list of books to be
named without determining their authority. The fourth party demanded
that all the books, acknowledged, disputed, and apocryphal, be declared
canonical. This party triumphed.</p>
<p>At a council of the Greek church held in Jerusalem in 1672, this
church, which had always refused to accept Revelation, finally placed
it in the canon. The Greek canon contains several apocryphal books not
contained in the Roman Catholic canon.</p>
<p>Both divisions of the Protestant church, German and English,
declared against the authority of the Apocryphal books. The Westminster
Assembly (1647) formally adopted the list of books contained in our
Authorized Version of the Bible.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ancient Christian Scholars.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most Christians believe that all of the books of the
Bible, and only the books of the Bible, have been accepted as canonical
by all Christians. And yet, how far from this is the truth! In every
age of the church there have been Christians, eminent for their piety
and learning, who either rejected some of these books, or who accepted
as canonical books not contained in the Bible. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb34" href="#pb34" name="pb34">34</a>]</span></p>
<p>Not one of the five men who contributed most to form the canon,
Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian, Clement, Jerome, and Augustine, accepted all
of these books.</p>
<p>Late in the second century Melito, Bishop of Sardis, a contemporary
of Iren&aelig;us, was deputed to make a list of the books belonging to
the Old Testament. His list omitted Esther and Lamentations.</p>
<p>The Muratori canon, which is supposed to belong to the third
century, omitted Hebrews, James, First and Second Peter, and Third
John. The Apostolic canon omitted Revelation, and included First and
Second Clement and the Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
<p>Of Origen, the great Christian Father of the third century,
&ldquo;Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopedia&rdquo; says: &ldquo;Origen doubted
the authority of the Epistle to the Hebrews, of the Epistle of James,
of Jude, of the Second of Peter, and the Second and Third of John;
while, at the same time, he was disposed to recognize as canonical
certain apocryphal scriptures, such as those of Hermas and
Barnabas.&rdquo; In addition to the apocryphal books named, Origen also
accepted as authoritative the Gospel of the Hebrews, Gospel of the
Egyptians, Acts of Paul, and Preaching of Peter.</p>
<p>The Rev. Jeremiah Jones, a leading authority on the canon, says:
&ldquo;Justin Martyr, Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, and the rest of
the primitive writers were wont to approve and cite <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb35" href="#pb35" name="pb35">35</a>]</span>books
which now all men know to be apocryphal&rdquo; (Canon, p. 4).</p>
<p>Theodoret says that as late as the fifth century many churches used
the Gospel of Tatian instead of the canonical Gospels. Gregory the
Great, at the beginning of the seventh, and Alfric, at the close of the
tenth century, accepted as canonical Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Laodiceans.</p>
<p>Early in the fourth century the celebrated church historian,
Eusebius, gave a list of the acknowledged and disputed books of the New
Testament. The disputed books&mdash;books which some accepted and
others rejected&mdash;were Hebrews, James, Second and Third John, Jude,
Revelation, Shepherd of Hermas, Epistle of Barnabas, Acts of Paul, and
Revelation of Peter.</p>
<p>Athanasius rejected Esther, and Epiphanius accepted the Epistle of
Jeremiah. Cyril, Bishop of Jerusalem, and Gregory, Bishop of
Constantinople, both rejected Revelation.</p>
<p>Chrysostom, one of the greatest of church divines, and, who gave to
the sacred book of Christians its name, omitted ten books from his
canon&mdash;First and Second Chronicles, Esther, Job, and Lamentations,
five books in the Old Testament; and Second Peter, Second and Third
John, Jude, and Revelation, five books in the New Testament.</p>

<p class="first">Many Protestant scholars have questioned or denied the
correctness of the Protestant canon. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb36" href="#pb36" name="pb36">36</a>]</span>Calvin doubted Second and
Third John and Revelation. Erasmus doubted Hebrews, Second and Third
John, and Revelation. Zwingle and Beza rejected Revelation. Dr. Lardner
questioned the authority of Hebrews, James, Second Peter, Second and
Third John, Jude and Revelation. Evanson rejected Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and nearly half of the Epistles. Schleiermacher rejected First Timothy.
Scaliger rejected Second Peter. Davidson thinks that Esther should be
excluded from the canon. Eichorn rejected Daniel and Jonah in the Old
Testament, and Second Timothy and Titus in the New.</p>
<p>Dr. Whiston excluded the Song of Solomon, and accepted as canonical
more than twenty books not found in the Bible. He says: &ldquo;Can
anyone be so weak as to imagine Mark, and Luke, and James, and Jude,
who were none of them more than companions of the Apostles, to be our
sacred and unerring guides, while Barnabas, Thaddeus, Clement, Timothy,
Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who were equally companions of the same
Apostles, to be of no authority at all?&rdquo; (Exact Time, p. 28).</p>
<p>The Rev. James Martineau, of England, says: &ldquo;If we could
recover the Gospel of the Hebrews, and that of the Egyptians, it would
be difficult to give a reason why they should not form a part of the
New Testament; and an epistle by Clement, the fellow laborer of Paul,
which has as good a claim to stand there as the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb37" href="#pb37" name="pb37">37</a>]</span>Epistle
to the Hebrews, or the Gospel of Luke&rdquo; (Rationale of Religious
Enquiry).</p>
<p>Archbishop Wake pronounces the writings of the Apostolic Fathers
&ldquo;inspired,&rdquo; and says that they contain &ldquo;an
authoritative declaration of the Gospel of Christ&rdquo; (Apostolic
Fathers).</p>
<p>The church of Latter Day Saints, numbering one half million
adherents, and including some able Bible scholars, believe that the
modern Book of Mormon is a part of God&rsquo;s Word, equal in authority
and importance to the Pentateuch or the Four Gospels.</p>

<h3 class="main">Martin Luther.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The greatest name in the records of the Protestant
church is Martin Luther. He is generally recognized as its founder; he
is considered one of the highest authorities on the Bible; he devoted a
large portion of his life to its study; he made a translation of it for
his people, a work which is accepted as one of the classics of German
literature. With Luther the Bible superseded the church as a divine
authority. And yet this greatest of Protestants rejected no less than
six of the sixty-six books composing the Protestant Bible.</p>
<p>Luther rejected the book of Esther. He says: &ldquo;I am such an
enemy to the book of Esther that I wish it did not exist.&rdquo; In his
&ldquo;Bondage of the Will,&rdquo; he severely criticises the book.</p>
<p>He rejected the book of Jonah. He says: &ldquo;The history of Jonah
is so monstrous as to be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb38" href=
"#pb38" name="pb38">38</a>]</span>absolutely incredible&rdquo;
(Colloquia, Chap. LX., Sec. 10).</p>
<p>He rejected Hebrews: &ldquo;The Epistle to the Hebrews is not by St.
Paul; nor, indeed, by any apostle&rdquo; (Standing Preface to
Luther&rsquo;s New Testament).</p>
<p>He rejected the Epistle of James: &ldquo;St. James&rsquo; Epistle is
truly an epistle of straw&rdquo; (Preface to Edition of 1524).</p>
<p>He rejected Jude. &ldquo;The Epistle of Jude,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;allegeth stories and sayings which have no place in
Scripture&rdquo; (Standing Preface).</p>
<p>He rejected Revelation. He says: &ldquo;I can discover no trace that
it is established by the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Preface to Edition of
1522). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb39" href="#pb39" name=

<h2 class="main">DIFFERENT VERSIONS OF THE BIBLE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following is a brief description of the principal
versions, translations, and manuscripts of the Bible:</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Versions of the Jewish Scriptures.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Hebrew.</span>&mdash;The greater
portion of the Jewish Scriptures was written in the ancient Hebrew
language, while a smaller portion was written in the Aramaic or
Chaldaic dialect of this language. The written language of the Hebrew
contained no vowels. The meaning of many words was mere conjecture.
About one thousand years ago Jewish scholars developed a system of
vowel points and made a revision of the Hebrew Scriptures in what is
known as the Masoretic text. The early Christian versions of the Old
Testament, including that of the Roman Catholic church, are based upon
the earlier or consonantal text; the Protestant versions are based upon
the later or Masoretic text. The accepted Hebrew versions generally
omitted the Apocryphal books.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Samaritan.</span>&mdash;The Samaritan Bible, the
canonical Scriptures of the Samaritan Israelites, contained
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb40" href="#pb40" name=
"pb40">40</a>]</span>but six books&mdash;the Pentateuch and what is
styled a corrupt version of Joshua. Some scholars believe that the
Samaritan Pentateuch is the most correct version we have of this
work.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Septuagint.</span>&mdash;The Septuagint was a Greek
translation of the Jewish Scriptures, including the Apocryphal books.
We are told that about 285 b. c. seventy scholars, each in a separate
cell, translated all of these books. The translations, it is stated,
were exactly alike, a proof of divine supervision. This story is a
fiction. Instead of seventy translations of fifty books, there was one
translation of five books. The Pentateuch alone was translated at this
time. The Prophets, the Hagiographa, and the Apocrypha were translated
at various times during the succeeding three hundred years. The
Septuagint was the version used by the Hellenistic Jews and by the
primitive Christians.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ancient Christian Versions.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Peshito.</span>&mdash;The Peshito is
probably the oldest version of the Christian Bible. It is in Aramaic,
and is the Bible of Syrian Christians. It omits Second Peter, Second
and Third John, Jude, and Revelation.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Egyptian.</span>&mdash;There were two versions of
the Egyptian Bible, the Thebaic, written in the language of Upper
Egypt, and the Memphitic or Coptic, written in the language of Lower
Egypt. These versions included the Apocrypha and excluded Revelation.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb41" href="#pb41" name=
"pb41">41</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Ethiopic<span class="corr" id="xd26e1374" title=
"Not in source">.</span></span>&mdash;This was the Bible of Ethiopian
Christians. The Old Testament contained four divisions: 1. The Law; 2.
Kings; 3. Solomon; 4. The Prophets. It also contained the Book of
Enoch, a book found in no other version. The New Testament omitted
Revelation and included the Apostolic Constitutions.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Gothic.</span>&mdash;This version was made by a
Gothic bishop in the fourth century. It omitted four of the principal
books of the Old Testament, First and Second Samuel, and First and
Second Kings.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Italic.</span>&mdash;The Italic version was one of
the earliest Latin versions of the Bible. The New Testament contained
but twenty-four books. It omitted Hebrews, James, and Second Peter.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Vulgate.</span>&mdash;The Vulgate, one of the most
important versions of the Bible, is the Latin version made by Jerome
about the beginning of the fifth century. It is the standard version of
the Roman Catholic church. It has undergone many revisions and
consequently many changes. It now includes the Apocryphal books which
Jerome did not accept as canonical.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ancient Manuscripts.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The three most important Greek manuscripts, those
which are recognized as the highest authorities in determining the text
of the Bible, are the Sinaitic, the Vatican, and the Alexandrian.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Sinaitic.</span>&mdash;The Sinaitic Manuscript, now
preserved <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb42" href="#pb42" name=
"pb42">42</a>]</span>in St. Petersburg, was discovered by Dr.
Tischendorf at a convent near Mount Sinai. It is believed by many to be
the oldest manuscript of the New Testament extant, dating back, it is
supposed by some, to the fourth century. It contains twenty-nine
books&mdash;the twenty-seven canonical books, the Epistle of Barnabas,
and the Shepherd of Hermas.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Vatican.</span>&mdash;This manuscript, now in the
Vatican library at Rome, belongs, it is claimed, to the fourth century.
The Old Testament contains the Apocrypha. The New Testament is a
mutilated copy, containing only the Four Gospels, Acts, and a part of
the Epistles.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Alexandrian.</span>&mdash;The Alexandrian
Manuscript, now in the British Museum, belongs, it is said, to the
fifth or sixth century. The Old Testament includes the Apocryphal
books. The New Testament includes the canonical books, and in addition
to these the First and Second Epistles of Clement.</p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first"><span class="sc">Luther&rsquo;s.</span>&mdash;The
principal German version of the Bible was made by the leader of the
Protestant Reformation. On account of its superior literary merits and
its large circulation it is, next to our Authorized Version, the most
important of the Protestant versions. Luther placed the Apocryphal
books in an appendix at the end of the Old Testament, and the books of
the New Testament which he rejected in an appendix at the end of the
New. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb43" href="#pb43" name=
"pb43">43</a>]</span></p>
<p><span class="sc">Wicliffe&rsquo;s.</span>&mdash;The translation of
Wicliffe, which appeared in the latter part of the fourteenth century,
was the first English translation of the Bible.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Tyndale&rsquo;s.</span>&mdash;Tyndale commenced his
English translation of the Bible about the same time that Luther
commenced his German translation. He did not live to complete it, and a
portion of the Old Testament was translated by others.</p>
<p><span class="sc">King James.</span>&mdash;The Authorized English
Version, commonly called the King James Bible, was published in 1611.
It was made by forty-seven English scholars, working in six
companies&mdash;two at Oxford, two at Cambridge, and two at
Westminster. The basis of this version is Tyndale&rsquo;s translation.
The Apocryphal books, which were not accepted as canonical by the
English church, were placed in an appendix. They are now generally
omitted. The King James Bible is admittedly one of the most incorrect
versions; but dressed in the strong, quaint English of <span class=
"corr" id="xd26e1428" title=
"Source: Shakspere&rsquo;s">Shakespeare&rsquo;s</span> time it
possesses considerable literary merit. It has been translated into
nearly every tongue, and has had a larger circulation than all others
combined.</p>
<p><span class="sc">New Version.</span>&mdash;The new or Revised
Version of the Bible is a revision of the King James version. The
revision was made by a Committee of twenty-seven English scholars,
whose work was revised by an American committee. It was begun in 1870
and finished in 1882. In this version the matter is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb44" href="#pb44" name="pb44">44</a>]</span>divided
into paragraphs instead of chapters and verses.</p>
<p><span class="sc">Douay.</span>&mdash;The Douay Bible is an English
translation of the Vulgate. It is the standard English version of the
Roman Catholic church.</p>
<p>The foregoing are but a few of the numerous versions of the Bible,
ancient and modern, that have appeared. Nearly every nation of Europe
has from one to a score. Luther&rsquo;s version is nearly 400 years
old, and yet Germany had seventeen translations, and consequently
seventeen versions, before Luther&rsquo;s was published. England had
many versions besides those named. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb45"

<h2 class="main">AUTHORSHIP AND DATES.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Upon the authenticity of the books of the Bible
depends in a large measure their value as authorities. These books are
filled with strange and marvelous stories. Are these stories true or
false? If true, we should accept them; if false, reject them. From
whence do these writings come?</p>
<p>If you hear a startling statement on the street your disposition to
accept or reject it will depend largely upon the character of its
author. If he is a reputable person you will be disposed to accept it;
if it does not come from a reputable person, or if you are unable to
discover its author, you will be disposed to reject it. Christian
priests demand the acceptance of these books as infallible truth. What
evidence do they adduce to justify this demand? Where did they obtain
these books? When were they written? Who wrote them? What is the
reputation of their authors for intelligence and veracity? Were they
learned and astute men, or were they weak and credulous men? Were they
good men, or were they bad men? If able <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb46" href="#pb46" name="pb46">46</a>]</span>men wrote them, may they
not have been impostors? If good men wrote them, may they not have been
mistaken?</p>
<p>These priests claim to have a knowledge of the authorship of all, or
nearly all, the books of the Bible. With one or two exceptions, they
have assigned authors to all the books of the Old Testament, and to
these exceptions they have even assigned &ldquo;probable&rdquo;
authors. They also claim a great antiquity for them&mdash;claim that
they were written from four hundred to fifteen hundred years before the
Christian era. The books of the New Testament, they affirm, were all
written in the first century, and by those whose names they bear.</p>
<p>The following table gives the authorship and date of composition,
according to orthodox authorities, of the books composing the
Protestant canon. It is not claimed that every book was written in the
year assigned for its composition, but that it was written in or prior
to the year assigned.</p>

<p>The names and dates given in the foregoing table are, with a few
exceptions, paraded as established facts. And yet the greater portion
of them are mere assumptions, without even the shadow of proof upon
which to base them. Many of them are self-evidently false&mdash;are
contradicted by the contents of the books themselves. The authorship of
at least fifty books of the Bible&mdash;thirty in the Old Testament and
twenty in the New&mdash;is unknown. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb49"
href="#pb49" name="pb49">49</a>]</span></p>
<p>These books are not as old as claimed. The books of the Old
Testament, instead of having been written from 1520 to 420 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>, were probably written from 1000 to 100 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> The books of the New Testament, instead of having all
been written in the first century, were, many of them, not written
until the second century.</p>
<p>In regard to this subject, Prof. George T. Ladd of Yale College
writes: &ldquo;The authorship and date of most of the Old Testament
writings, and of some of the New Testament, will never be known with
certainty&rdquo; (What Is the Bible? p. 294).</p>
<p>The following six chapters will be devoted to an examination of the
question of the authenticity of the books of the Bible. I shall attempt
to show that the greater portion of these books, including the most
important ones, are not authentic&mdash;were not written by the authors
claimed, nor at the time claimed; that they are anonymous documents,
written or compiled for the most part at a later age than that in which
their reputed authors are supposed to have lived. <span class=

<h2 class="label">CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<h2 class="main">THE PENTATEUCH.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The first five books of the Bible, Genesis, Exodus,
Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy&mdash;collectively called the
Pentateuch&mdash;are the most important books of the Old Testament. The
three great Semitic religions, Judaism, Christianity, and
Mohammedanism, are all, to a great extent, based upon them.</p>
<p>These books, orthodox Christians affirm, were written by Moses at
least 1,450 years before the Christian era. &ldquo;This sacred
code,&rdquo; says Dr. Adam Clarke, &ldquo;Moses delivered complete to
the Hebrews sometime before his death.&rdquo; In modern versions of the
Bible, Genesis is styled the First Book of Moses; Exodus, the Second
Book of Moses; Leviticus, the Third Book of Moses; Numbers, the Fourth
Book of Moses, and Deuteronomy, the Fifth Book of Moses. Their very
high authority rests upon the supposed fact of their Mosaic authorship
and great antiquity. To disprove these&mdash;to show that the
Pentateuch was not written by Moses, nor at this early age, but
centuries later by unknown writers&mdash;is to largely impair, if not
entirely destroy, its authority as a religious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb51" href="#pb51" name="pb51">51</a>]</span>oracle.
And this is what modern criticism has done.</p>

<h3 class="main">Arguments for Mosaic Authorship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The following passage is the chief argument relied
upon to prove the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass, that when Moses had made an end of
writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished, that
Moses commanded the Levites, which bore the ark of the covenant of the
Lord, saying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the
ark of the covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a
witness against thee&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

xxxi, 24&ndash;26</a>).</p>
<p>This was written for a purpose. Its sequel appears in 2 Kings.
During the reign of Josiah, Hilkiah the high priest discovered a
&ldquo;book of the law&rdquo; in the temple. &ldquo;And Hilkiah the
high priest said unto Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the
law in the house of the Lord&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2022:8&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings xxii, 8</a>).</p>
<p>This book was the book of Deuteronomy, written, not in the time of
Moses, but in the time of Josiah, more than eight centuries later.
Hilkiah needed the book and he &ldquo;found&rdquo; it. It was written
by him or for him. Holland&rsquo;s great critic, Dr. Kuenen, says:
&ldquo;There is no room to doubt that the book was written with a view
to the use that Hilkiah made of it&rdquo; (Kuenen&rsquo;s Hexateuch, p.
215). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb52" href="#pb52" name=
"pb52">52</a>]</span></p>
<p>Dr. Oort, another able Dutch scholar, professor of Oriental
languages at Amsterdam, says: &ldquo;The book was certainly written
about the time of its discovery. It is true that it introduces Moses as
uttering the precepts and exhortations of which it consists, just
before the people enter Canaan. But this is no more than a literary
fiction. The position of affairs assumed throughout the book is that of
Judah in the time of Josiah&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. ii, p.
331).</p>
<p>In support of this unanimous conclusion of the critics, Dr. Briggs
presents the following long array of irrefutable arguments:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The reasons for the composition of Deuteronomy in the time of
Josiah according to the later hypothesis are: (1) Expressions which
indicate a period subsequent to the Conquest (ii, 12; xix, 14); (2) the
law of the king, which implies the reign of Solomon (xvii,
14&ndash;20); (3) the one supreme judicatory of the time of
<span class="corr" id="xd26e2169" title=
"Source: Jehosaphat">Jehoshaphat</span> (xvii, 8); (4) the one central
altar of the times of Hezekiah (xii, 5 <i>seq.</i>); (5) the return to
Egypt in ships not conceivable before the time of Manasseh (xxviii,
68); (6) the forms of idolatry of the middle period of the monarchy
(iv, 19; xvii, 3); (7) no trace of Deuteronomy in writings prior to
Jeremiah; (8) the point of view indicates an advanced style of
theological reflection; (9) the prohibition of Mazzebah (xvi, 22)
regarded as lawful in Isaiah (xix, 19); (10) the style implies a long
development of the art of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb53" href=
"#pb53" name="pb53">53</a>]</span>Hebrew oratory, and the language is
free from archaism, and suits the times preceding Jeremiah; (11) the
doctrine of the love of God and his faithfulness with the term
&lsquo;Yahweh thy God&rsquo; presuppose the experience of the prophet
Hosea; (12) the humanitarianism of Deuteronomy shows an ethical advance
beyond Amos and Isaiah and prepares the way for Jeremiah and Ezekiel;
(13) ancient laws embedded in the code account for the penalties for
their infraction in <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2022&amp;version=NRSV">
2 Kings xxii</a>; (14) ancient laws of war are associated with laws
which imply the wars of the monarchy, and have been influenced by
Amos&rdquo; (The Hexateuch, p. 261).</p>
<p>No book had been deposited in the ark as the writer stated. At the
dedication of Solomon&rsquo;s temple the ark was opened, but it
contained no book. &ldquo;There was nothing in the ark save the two
tables of stone, which Moses put there at Horeb&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Kgs%208:5-9&amp;version=NRSV">1
Kings viii, 5&ndash;9</a>).</p>
<p>In the Pentateuch it is also stated that Moses, at the command of
God, wrote certain covenants (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2034:27&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xxxiv, 27</a>), recorded the curse of Amalek (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2017:14&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xvii, 14</a>), and made a list of the stations between the Red Sea and
the Jordan (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2033&amp;version=NRSV">Num.
xxxiii</a>); likewise that he wrote a song (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2031:22&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxi, 22</a>). The absurdity of adducing these to prove that Moses
wrote the Pentateuch is thus exposed by Briggs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the author of the Pentateuch says that Moses wrote one
or more codes of law, that he wrote a song, that he recorded a certain
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb54" href="#pb54" name=
"pb54">54</a>]</span>memorandum, it would appear that having specified
such of his materials as were written by Moses, he would have us infer
that the other materials came from other sources of information. But it
has been urged the other way; namely, that, because it is said that
Moses wrote the codes of the covenant and the Deuteronomic code, he
also wrote all the laws of the Pentateuch; that because he wrote the
song <a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2032&amp;version=NRSV">
Deut. xxxii</a>, he wrote all the other pieces of poetry in the
Pentateuch, that because he recorded the list of stations and the
memorial against Amalek, he recorded all the other historical events of
the Pentateuch. It is probable that no one would so argue did he not
suppose it was necessary to maintain the Mosaic authorship of the
Pentateuch at every cost&rdquo; (Hexateuch, pp. 10, 11).</p>
<p>Again, it has been argued that Christ and some of the writers of the
New Testament recognize Moses as the author of the Pentateuch. Such
expressions as &ldquo;the law of Moses,&rdquo; &ldquo;the book of
Moses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Moses said,&rdquo; etc., occur a few times. These
expressions are explained and this argument answered by the following:
1. It is not denied by critics that Moses was the legislator of the
Jews and promulgated certain laws. 2. An anonymous book is usually
called after the leading character of the book. 3. At this time the
traditional theory of the Mosaic authorship was generally accepted. Of
Christ&rsquo;s mention of Moses, Dr. Davidson says: &ldquo;The
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb55" href="#pb55" name=
"pb55">55</a>]</span>venerable authority of Christ himself has no
proper bearing on the question.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Arguments Against Mosaic Authorship.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the Pentateuch was not written by Moses, that it
is an anonymous work belonging to a later age, is clearly proven by the
following:</p>
<p>1. There is no proof that Moses ever claimed to be the author of the
Pentateuch. There is nothing in the work, neither is there anything
outside of it, to indicate that he was its author.</p>
<p>2. The ancient Hebrews did not believe that he wrote it. Renan says:
&ldquo;The opinion which attributes the composition of the Pentateuch
to Moses seems quite modern; it is very certain that the ancient
Hebrews never dreamed of regarding their legislator as their historian.
The ancient documents appeared to them absolutely impersonal, and they
attached to them no author&rsquo;s name&rdquo; (History of Semitic
Languages, Book II., chapter i).</p>
<p>3. The Pentateuch was written in the Hebrew language. The Hebrew of
the Bible did not exist in the time of Moses. Language is a growth. It
takes centuries to develop it. It took a thousand years to develop the
English language. The Hebrew of the Bible was not brought from Egypt,
but grew in Palestine. Referring to this language, De Wette says:
&ldquo;Without doubt it originated in the land [Canaan] or was still
further developed therein after the Hebrew and other Canaanitish people
had migrated <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb56" href="#pb56" name=
"pb56">56</a>]</span>thither from the Northern country&rdquo; (Old
Testament, Part II.). Gesenius says that the Hebrew language scarcely
antedates the time of David.</p>
<p>4. Not only is it true that the Hebrew language did not exist, but
it is urged by critics that no written language, as we understand it,
existed in Western Asia in the time of Moses. Prof. Andrew Norton says:
&ldquo;For a long time after the supposed date of the Pentateuch we
find no proof of the existence of a book or even an inscription in
proper alphabetical characters among the nations by whom the Hebrews
were surrounded&rdquo; (The Pentateuch, p. 44). Hieroglyphics were then
in use, and it is not to be supposed that a work as large as the
Pentateuch was written or engraved in hieroglyphics and carried about
by this wandering tribe of ignorant Israelites.</p>
<p>5. Much of the Pentateuch is devoted to the history of Moses; but
excepting a few brief compositions attributed to him and quoted by the
author he is always referred to in the third person. The Pentateuch
contains a biography, not an autobiography of Moses.</p>
<p>6. It contains an account of the death and burial of Moses which he
could not have written:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of
Moab&#8202;&hellip;. And he buried him in a valley of the land of
Moab&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2034:5-6&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxiv, 5, 6</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
Moab thirty days&rdquo; (8). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb57" href=
"#pb57" name="pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>Orthodox commentators attempt to remove this difficulty by supposing
that the last chapter of Deuteronomy belongs to the book of Joshua, and
that Joshua recorded the death of Moses. The same writer, referring to
the appointment of Joshua as the successor of Moses, says: &ldquo;And
Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2034:9&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxiv, 9</a>). If Joshua wrote this, however full of the spirit of
wisdom he may have been, he certainly was not full of the spirit of
modesty. Joshua did not write this chapter.</p>
<p>7. &ldquo;No man knoweth of his [Moses&rsquo;] sepulchre unto this
day&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2034:6&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxiv, 6</a>).</p>
<p>That the authorship of this chapter should ever have been attributed
to either Moses or Joshua is incomprehensible. The language plainly
shows that not merely one but many generations had elapsed between the
time of Moses and the time that it was written.</p>
<p>8. While the advocates of the Mosaic authorship have, without proof,
asserted that Joshua wrote the book of Joshua and the conclusion of
Deuteronomy, the Higher Critics have demonstrated the common authorship
of Deuteronomy and a large portion of Joshua. As all the events
recorded in Joshua occurred after the death of Moses, he could not have
been the author of Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>9. &ldquo;They [the Israelites] did eat manna until they came unto
the borders of Canaan&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2016:35&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xvi, 35</a>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb58" href="#pb58" name=
"pb58">58</a>]</span></p>
<p>This passage was written after the Israelites settled in Canaan and
ceased to subsist on manna. And this was not until after the death of
Moses.</p>
<p>10. &ldquo;The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the
children of Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from
before them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
his possession, which the Lord gave unto them&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%202:12&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
ii, 12</a>).</p>
<p>This refers to the conquest of Canaan and was written after that
event.</p>
<p>11. &ldquo;And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness
they found a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath day&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2015:32&amp;version=NRSV">Num.
xv, 32</a>).</p>
<p>When this was written the children of Israel were no longer in the
wilderness. Their sojourn there is referred to as a past event. As
Moses died while they were still in the wilderness&mdash;that is,
before they had entered the promised land&mdash;it could not have been
written by him.</p>
<p>12. &ldquo;Thou shalt eat it within thy gates&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2015:22&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xv, 22</a>).</p>
<p>The phrase, &ldquo;within thy gates,&rdquo; occurs in the Pentateuch
about twenty-five times. It refers to the gates of the cities of the
Israelites, which they did not inhabit until after the death of
Moses.</p>
<p>13. &ldquo;Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments,
&hellip; that the land spew not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
spewed out the nations that were before you&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lv%2018:26-28&amp;version=NRSV">Lev.
xviii, 26, 28</a>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb59" href="#pb59"
name="pb59">59</a>]</span></p>
<p>When Moses died the nations alluded to still occupied the land and
had not been expelled.</p>
<p>14. &ldquo;And Abraham called the name of the place Jehovah-jireh:
as it is said to this day, In the mount of the Lord it shall be
seen&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2022:14&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxii, 14</a>).</p>
<p>This is one of the passages adduced by the critics of the
seventeenth century against the Mosaic authorship of these books. It
implies the conquest and a long occupancy of the land by the
Israelites.</p>
<p>15. &ldquo;And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; the same is Hebron in the
land of Canaan&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2023:2&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxiii, 2</a>). &ldquo;And Jacob came &hellip; unto the city of Arbah,
which is Hebron&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2035:27&amp;version=NRSV">xxxv,
27</a>).</p>
<p>Moses&rsquo; uncle was named Hebron, and from him the Hebronites
were descended. After the Conquest this family settled in Kirjath-arba
and changed the name of the city to Hebron.</p>
<p>16. &ldquo;And Rachel died and was buried in the way to Ephrath,
which is Bethlehem&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2035:19&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxxv, 19</a>).</p>
<p>The Hebrew name of Bethlehem was not given to this city until after
the Israelites had conquered and occupied it.</p>
<p>17. &ldquo;For only Og, king of Bashan, remained of the remnant of
giants; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
Rabbath of the children of Ammon?&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%203:11&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
iii, 11</a>.)</p>
<p>This is another passage relied upon by the early critics to disprove
the Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch. The writer&rsquo;s reference
to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb60" href="#pb60" name=
"pb60">60</a>]</span>the bedstead of Og, which was still preserved as a
relic at Rabbath, indicates a time long subsequent to the conquest of
Bashan.</p>
<p>18. &ldquo;Thou shalt not remove thy neighbor&rsquo;s landmark,
which they of old time have set in thine inheritance&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2019:14&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xix, 14</a>).</p>
<p>This refers to the ancient landmarks set by the Israelites when they
obtained possession of Canaan, and was written centuries after that
time.</p>
<p>19. &ldquo;And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small
towns thereof, and called them Havoth-jair&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2032:41&amp;version=NRSV">Num.
xxxii, 41</a>).</p>
<p>The above is evidently a misstatement of an event recorded in
Judges:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after him [Tola] arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged
Israel twenty and two years. And he had thirty sons, &hellip; and they
had thirty cities, which are called Havoth-jair unto this day&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jd%2010:3-4&amp;version=NRSV">Jud.
x, 3, 4</a>).</p>
<p>Jair was judge of Israel from 1210 to 1188 <span class=
"sc">b.c.</span>, or from 241 to 263 years after the date assigned for
the writing of the Pentateuch.</p>
<p>20. &ldquo;And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof,
and called it Nobah, after his own name&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2032:42&amp;version=NRSV">Num.
xxxii, 42</a>).</p>
<p>Referring to this and the preceding passage, Dr. Oort says:
&ldquo;It is certain that Jair, the Gileadite, the conqueror of Bashan,
after whom thirty places were called Jair&rsquo;s villages, lived in
the time of the Judges, and that a part of Bashan was conquered at a
still later period by <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb61" href="#pb61"
name="pb61">61</a>]</span>a certain Nobah&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
vol. i, p. 329).</p>
<p>21. &ldquo;Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob
unto the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own
name, Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%203:14&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
iii, 14</a>).</p>
<p>Even if Jair had lived in the time of Moses, the phrase &ldquo;unto
this day&rdquo; shows that it was written long after the event
described.</p>
<p>22. &ldquo;And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive,
he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three hundred and
eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2014:14&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xiv, 14</a>).</p>
<p>This passage could not have been written before Dan existed. In
Judges (xviii, 26&ndash;29) the following account of the origin of this
place is given: &ldquo;And the children of Dan went their way; &hellip;
and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at quiet and secure; and
they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with
fire&#8202;&hellip;. And they built a city, and dwelt therein. And they
called the name of the city Dan.&rdquo; This is placed after the death
of Samson, and Samson died, according to Bible chronology, 1120
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>&mdash;331 years after Moses died.</p>
<p>23. &ldquo;And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom
before there reigned any king over the children of Israel&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2036:31&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxxvi, 31</a>). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb62" href="#pb62" name=
"pb62">62</a>]</span></p>
<p>This could not have been written before the kingdom of Israel was
established; for the writer is familiar with the fact that kings have
reigned in Israel. Saul, the first king of Israel, began to reign 356
years after Moses.</p>
<p>24. &ldquo;And his [Israel&rsquo;s] king shall be higher than
Agag&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%2024:7&amp;version=NRSV">Num.
xxiv, 7</a>).</p>
<p>This refers to Saul&rsquo;s defeat of Agag. &ldquo;And he [Saul]
took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all
the people with the edge of the sword&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Sm%2015:8&amp;version=NRSV">1
Sam. xv, 8</a>). The defeat of Agag is placed in 1067 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>, 384 years after Moses.</p>
<p>25. &ldquo;The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, &hellip; until
Shiloh come&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2049:10&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xlix, 10</a>).</p>
<p>These words are ascribed to Jacob; but they could not have been
written before Judah received the sceptre, which was not until David
ascended the throne, 396 years after the death of Moses.</p>
<p>26. &ldquo;And the Canaanite was then in the land&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2012:6&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xii, 6</a>).</p>
<p>When this was written the Canaanite had ceased to be an inhabitant
of Palestine. As a remnant of the Canaanites inhabited this country up
to the time of David, it could not have been written prior to his
time.</p>
<p>27. &ldquo;The Canaanite and the Perizzite dwelt then in the
land&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

<p>This, like the preceding passage, could not have been written before
the time of David. The Perizzites, also, inhabited Palestine for a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb63" href="#pb63" name=

Judges &ldquo;the children of Israel dwelt among the &hellip;

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2023:19&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xxiii, 19</a>).</p>
<p>This was not written before the time of Solomon; for God had no
house prior to the erection of the temple, 1004 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>, 447 years after Moses. When David proposed to build
him a house, he forbade it and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought
up the children of Israel out of Egypt, even to this day, but have
walked in a tent and in a tabernacle&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sm%207:6&amp;version=NRSV">2
Sam. vii, 6</a>).</p>
<p>The tabernacle itself was a tent (Tent of Meeting). During all this
time no house was ever used as a sanctuary.</p>

<p>This proves the late origin of the Pentateuch, or at least of
Deuteronomy. Isaiah (xix, 19) instructs them to do the very thing which
they are here forbidden to do, and as he would not have advised a

<p>Christians affirm that the Law of Moses and the Pentateuch are one.
That this Law of Moses was not the one hundred and fifty thousand words
of the Pentateuch is shown by the fact that after the death of Moses it
was all engraved upon a stone altar.</p>
<p>37. &ldquo;Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which
were upon the face of the earth&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"

<p>No writer would bestow such fulsome praise upon himself. This was
written by a devout admirer of Moses, but it was not written by
Moses.</p>
<p>38. &ldquo;And this is the blessing wherewith Moses the man of God
blessed the children of Israel before his death&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2033:1&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxiii, 1</a>).</p>
<p>There are three reasons for rejecting the Mosaic authorship of this:
Moses is spoken of in laudatory terms; he is spoken of in the third
person; his death is referred to as an event that is already past.</p>
<p>39. &ldquo;And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto
Moses&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2034:10&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxxiv, 10</a>).</p>
<p>Not only is the highest praise bestowed upon Moses, a thing which he
would not have done, but the language clearly shows that it was written
centuries after the time he lived.</p>
<p>40. The religious history of the Hebrews embraces three periods of
time, each covering centuries. During the first period the worship of
Jehovah was confined to no particular place; during the second it was
confined to the holy <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb67" href="#pb67"
name="pb67">67</a>]</span>city, Jerusalem; during the third it was
confined, not merely to Jerusalem, but to the temple itself. There are
writings in the Pentateuch belonging to each of these periods. The
Encyclopedia Britannica declares that this fact alone affords
overwhelming disproof of Mosaic authorship.</p>
<p>41. The religion of the Pentateuch was not a revelation, but an
evolution. The priestly offices, the feasts, the sacrifices, and other
religious observances underwent many changes, these changes
representing different stages of development in Israel&rsquo;s religion
and requiring centuries of time to effect.</p>
<p>42. The legislation of the Pentateuch was also the growth of
centuries. Some of the minor codes are much older than the documents
containing them. There is legislation older than David, 1055
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>&mdash;probably as old as Moses, 1451
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> There is legislation belonging to the time
of Josiah, 626 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, of Ezekiel, 575
<span class="sc">B.C.</span>, of Ezra, 456 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
Would it not be absurd to claim that all the laws of England from
Alfred to Victoria were the work of one mind, Alfred? And is it less
absurd to claim that all the laws of the Jews from Moses to Ezra were
instituted by Moses?</p>
<p>43. The Pentateuch abounds with repetitions and contradictions. The
first two chapters of Genesis contain two accounts of the Creation
differing in every important particular. In the sixth, seventh, and
eighth chapters of Genesis <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb68" href=
"#pb68" name="pb68">68</a>]</span>two different and contradictory
accounts of the Deluge are intermingled. Exodus and Deuteronomy each
contain a copy of the Decalogue, the two differing as to the reason
assigned for the institution of the Sabbath. There are several
different versions of the call of Abraham; different and conflicting
stories of the Egyptian plagues; contradictory accounts of the conquest
of Canaan.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Work of Various Authors and Compilers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">44. The four preceding arguments suggest the
concluding and most important one. The character of the writings of the
Pentateuch preclude the possibility of unity of authorship, and
consequently the Mosaic authorship of the work as a whole. The books of
the Pentateuch were not all composed by one author. The book of Genesis
is not the work of one author. The first two chapters of Genesis were
not written by the same writer. The Pentateuch was written by various
writers and at various times.</p>
<p>The Pentateuch comprises four large documents known as the Elohistic
and Jehovistic documents, and the Deuteronomic and Priestly Codes. They
are distinguished by the initial letters E, J, D, and P. E and J
include the greater portion of Genesis and extend through the other
books of the Pentateuch, as well as through Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and
Kings. D includes the greater portion of Deuteronomy, fragments of the
preceding books, and a large <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb69" href=
"#pb69" name="pb69">69</a>]</span>portion of Joshua. P includes the
greater portion of the middle books of the Pentateuch and smaller
portions of the other books.</p>
<p>The author of each of these documents incorporated into his work one
or more older documents. These four works were afterwards united by
successive editors or redactors. E and J were first fused into one. A
subsequent redactor united D with this, and still later another united
this compilation with P.</p>
<p>In addition to these principal documents there are several minor
codes, chief of which is the Holiness Code comprising ten chapters of
<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lv%2017-26&amp;version=NRSV">
Leviticus, xvii-xxvi</a>. There are also several poems written by
various authors. Thus the Pentateuch instead of being the product of
one mind is the work of many writers and compilers, probably twenty or
more.</p>
<p>These documents, especially the principal ones, notwithstanding the
intermingling of their contents, are easily distinguished and separated
from each other by Bible critics. The thoughts of the human mind, like
the features of the human face, controlled by the law of variation,
assume different forms. We who are familiar with faces have no
difficulty in distinguishing one face from another. No two faces are
alike. Critics who have devoted their lives to literature can
distinguish the writings of individuals almost as readily as we
distinguish the faces of individuals. There are certain idioms of
language, certain peculiarities of style, belonging <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb70" href="#pb70" name="pb70">70</a>]</span>to each
writer. The language and style of these documents are quite dissimilar.
To quote Dr. Briggs: &ldquo;There is as great a difference in style
between the documents of the Hexateuch as there is between the Four
Gospels.&rdquo; The principal documents are thus described by this
critic:</p>
<p>&ldquo;E is brief, terse, and archaic; graphic, plastic, and
realistic; written in the theocratic interest of the kingdom of God. J
is poetical and descriptive, the best narrative in the Bible, giving us
the history of the kingdom of redemption. D is rhetorical and
hortatory, practical and earnest, written in the more theological
interest of the training of the nation in the fatherly instruction of
God. P is annalistic and diffuse, fond of names and dates, written in
the interest of the priestly order, and emphasizing the sovereignty of
the Holy God and the sanctity of the divine institutions&rdquo;
(Hexateuch, p. 265).</p>
<p>Each document abounds with characteristic words and phrases peculiar
to that document. Holzinger notes 108 belonging to E and 125 belonging
to J. Canon Driver gives 41 belonging to D and 50 belonging to P. One
of the chief distinguishing marks is the term used to designate the
Deity. In E it is Elohim, translated God; in J, Jehovah (Yahveh)
Elohim, translated Lord God. In D the writer continually uses the
phrase &ldquo;The Lord thy God,&rdquo; this phrase occurring more than
200 times. &ldquo;I am Jehovah&rdquo; is a phrase used by P, including
the Holiness <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb71" href="#pb71" name=
"pb71">71</a>]</span>Code, 70 times. It is never used by E or D.
&ldquo;God of the Fathers&rdquo; is frequently used by E and D; never
by P.</p>
<p>Bishop Colenso&rsquo;s analysis of Genesis is as follows: Elohist,
336 verses; Jehovist, 1,052 verses; Deuteronomist, 39 verses; Priestly
writer, 106 verses.</p>
<p>The Pentateuch was chiefly written and compiled from seven to ten
centuries after the time claimed. The Elohistic and Jehovistic
documents, the oldest of the four, were written at least 300 years
after the time of David and 700 years after the time of Moses. They
were probably written at about the same time. E belongs to the Northern
Kingdom of Israel, J to the Southern Kingdom of Judah. The unanimous
verdict of critics is that Deuteronomy was written during the reign of
Josiah, about 626 <i>B.C.</i>, 825 years after Moses died. The Holiness
Code belongs to the age of Ezekiel, about fifty years later. The
Priestly Code was written after the Exile, in the time of Ezra, 1,000
years after Moses. Important changes and additions were made as late as
the third century <i>B.C.</i>, so that, excepting the variations and
interpolations of later times, the Pentateuch in something like its
present form appeared about 1,200 years after the time of Moses.</p>

<p class="first">The certainty and the consequences of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb72" href="#pb72" name="pb72">72</a>]</span>Higher
Criticism of the Pentateuch are thus expressed by Hupfeld:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The discovery that the Pentateuch is put together out of
various sources, or original documents, is beyond all doubt not only
one of the most important and most pregnant with consequences for the
interpretation of the historical books of the Old Testament, or rather
for the whole of theology and history, but it is also one of the most
certain discoveries which have been made in the domain of criticism and
the history of literature. Whatever the anti-critical party may bring
forward to the contrary, it will maintain itself, and not retrograde
again through anything, so long as there exists such a thing as
criticism, and it will not be easy for a reader upon the stage of
culture on which we stand in the present day, if he goes to the
examination unprejudiced, and with an uncorrupted power of appreciating
the truth, to be able to ward off its influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The critical labors of Hobbes, Spinoza, Peyrerius, Simon, Astruc,
Eichorn, Paine, Bauer, (G. L.) De Wette, Ewald, Geddes, Vater, Reuss,
Graf, Davidson, Colenso, Hupfeld, Wellhausen, Kuenen, Briggs, and
others, have overthrown the old notions concerning the authenticity of
the Pentateuch. There is not one eminent Bible scholar in Europe, and
scarcely one in America, who any longer contends that Moses wrote this
work.</p>
<p>The pioneers in the field of the Higher Criticism <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb73" href="#pb73" name="pb73">73</a>]</span>were the
Rationalists Hobbes and Spinoza and the Catholics Peyrerius, Simon, and
Astruc. More than two hundred years ago Benedict Spinoza, the greatest
of modern Jews, with his own race and the entire Christian church
against him, made this declaration, which the scholarship of the whole
world now accepts:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is as clear as the noonday light that the Pentateuch was
not written by Moses&rdquo; (Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, Chap,
viii, Sec. 20).</p>
<p>A century passed, and Thomas Paine in France, in the most potent
volume of Higher Criticism ever penned, exposed in all their nakedness
the wretched claims of the traditionalists. He read the Pentateuch and
wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those books are spurious.&rdquo; &ldquo;Moses is not the
author of them.&rdquo; &ldquo;The style and manner in which those books
are written give no room to believe, or even to suppose, they were
written by Moses.&rdquo; &ldquo;They were not written in the time of
Moses, nor till several hundred years afterwards&rdquo; (Age of
Reason).</p>
<p>About the same time German scholars, ever foremost in the domain of
critical analysis, took up the work. The writings of Eichorn, Bauer,
Vater, and De Wette, &ldquo;swept the field in Germany.&rdquo; De
Wette, one of her greatest theologians, thus presents the conclusion of
German critics:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The opinion that Moses composed these books is not only
opposed by all the signs of a later date which occur in the work
itself, but <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb74" href="#pb74" name=
"pb74">74</a>]</span>also by the entire analogy of the history of
Hebrew literature and language&rdquo; (Books of Moses, Sec. 163).</p>
<p>Fifty years or more elapsed and Davidson and Colenso studied and
wrote, and British scholarship was soon arrayed against the old in
favor of the new. Dr. Davidson, in the following words, voices the
opinion of England&rsquo;s learned:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is little external evidence for the Mosaic authorship,
and what little there is does not stand the test of criticism. The
succeeding writers of the Old Testament do not confirm
it&#8202;&hellip;. The objections derived from internal structure are
conclusive against the Mosaic authorship&rdquo; (Introduction to the
Old Testament).</p>
<p>At last, in our own land and in our own time, Dr. Briggs and others
attack the Mosaic theories, and, in spite of the efforts of
Princeton&rsquo;s fossils, the intelligence of America acknowledges the
force of their reasoning and accepts their conclusions. The Higher
Criticism has triumphed. Spinoza&rsquo;s judgment is confirmed, and the
American critic pronounces the verdict of the intellectual world:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the field of scholarship the question is settled. It only
remains for the ministry and people to accept it and adapt themselves
to it&rdquo; (Hexateuch, p. 144).</p>
<p>But this is not the end. A victory has been achieved, but its full
results remain to be realized. The clergy, against their will, and the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb75" href="#pb75" name=
"pb75">75</a>]</span>laity, who are subservient to the clergy&rsquo;s
will, are yet to be enlightened and convinced. Even then, when the
facts disclosed by the Higher Criticism have gained popular acceptance,
another task remains&mdash;the task of showing men the real
significance of these facts. The critics themselves, many of them, do
not seem to realize the consequences of their work. The Rationalistic
critics, like Hobbes, Spinoza, Paine, Reuss, Wellhausen, Kuenen and
others, have measured the consequences of their criticisms and accepted
them. The orthodox critics have not. Some of them, like Dr. Briggs,
while denying the Mosaic authorship and great antiquity of the
Pentateuch, while maintaining its anonymous and fragmentary character,
and conceding its contradictions and errors, are yet loath to reject
its divinity and authority. But these also must be given up. This work
as a divine revelation and authentic record must go. Its chief
theological doctrine, the Fall of Man, is a myth. With this doctrine
falls the Atonement, and with the Atonement orthodox Christianity. This
is the logical sequence of the Higher Criticism of the Pentateuch. To
these critics, and to all who are intelligent enough to discern the
truth and courageous enough to meet it, I would repeat and press home
the admonition of our critic, &ldquo;to accept it and adapt themselves
to it.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb76" href="#pb76" name=

<p class="first">Next to the Pentateuch, the most important books of
the Old Testament are the Prophets. They are divided into two
divisions, Earlier and Later. The Earlier prophets comprise Joshua,
Judges, First Samuel, Second Samuel, First Kings, and Second Kings. The
Later Prophets are divided into Greater and Minor. The Greater Prophets
are Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel; the Minor Prophets, Hosea, Joel,
Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai,
Zechariah, and Malachi.</p>

<h3 class="main">Joshua.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The book of Joshua, it is claimed, was written by
Joshua just before his death, which occurred, according to the accepted
chronology, in 1426 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> This book for a time
formed a part of the Pentateuch (or Hexateuch). In later times, to
increase its authority, the Pentateuch was ascribed to Moses. A
recognition of the fact that Moses could not have written a history of
the events that happened after his death caused that portion now known
as Joshua to be detached and credited to Joshua. <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb77" href="#pb77" name="pb77">77</a>]</span></p>
<p>Many of the arguments adduced against the Mosaic authorship of the
preceding books apply with equal force against the claim that Joshua
wrote the book which bears his name. The book contains no internal
evidence of his authorship; he does not claim to be its author; the
other writers of the Old Testament do not ascribe its authorship to
him; he is spoken of in the third person; it is clearly the work of
more than one writer; the language in which it was written was not in
existence when he lived; much of it relates to events that occurred
after his death.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua, the son
of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died, being a hundred and ten years
old. And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
Timnath-serah&#8202;&hellip;. And Israel served the Lord all the days
of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that overlived Joshua&rdquo;

<p>As the Pentateuch gives an account of the death and burial of Moses,
so the book of Joshua gives an account of the death and burial of
Joshua.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Eleazer the son of Aaron died&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>The death of Eleazer occurred six years after the death of
Joshua.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the Jebusites dwell with the children of Judah at

<p>The children of Judah did not dwell in Jerusalem <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb78" href="#pb78" name="pb78">78</a>]</span>until
nearly 400 years after Joshua. The phrase &ldquo;unto this day&rdquo;
is frequently used in the book, and this shows that it was written long
after the events it describes.</p>
<p>In his account of the miracle of Joshua causing the sun to stand
still, the writer appeals to the book of Jasher in support of his
statement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is not this written in the book of Jasher?&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jo%2010:13&amp;version=NRSV">x,

<p>This could not have been written until after the book of Jasher was
written or compiled. When was Jasher written? We do not know, but in
his history of David the author of Samuel thus refers to it: &ldquo;He
[David] bade them teach the children of Judah the use of the bow;
behold, it is written in the book of Jasher&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Sm%201:18&amp;version=NRSV">2
Sam. i, 18</a>). This proves that the book of Jasher was not written
before the time of David. If the book of Joshua was not written until
after the book of Jasher was written, then it could not have been
written until the time of David or later.</p>
<p>The book of Joshua consists of two parts. The first, which
originally formed a part of, or sequel to, Deuteronomy, was probably
written before the Captivity; the latter part was written after the
captivity&mdash;900 years after the time of Joshua.</p>

<p>Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It is

admitted, was written as <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb80" href=

possibly as late as the time of Ezra, from 450 to 600 years after
Samuel.</p>
<p>Judges, like the Pentateuch and Joshua, is the work of several
writers. It can scarcely be called even a compilation. It is a mere
collection of historical and mythological fragments, thrown together
without any regard to logical arrangement or chronological order.</p>

<h3 class="main">First and Second Samuel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is popularly supposed, and many Christian teachers
affirm, that Samuel wrote the books which bear his name. And yet the
writer says, &ldquo;Samuel died,&rdquo; and seven chapters of the first
book follow this announcement. The second book in no way pertains to
him; his name is not once mentioned; the events narrated occurred from
four to forty-four years after his death.</p>
<p>Others claim that the books were written by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad,
basing their claim on a passage in Chronicles, which says that the acts
of David &ldquo;are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the
book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Chr%2029:29&amp;version=NRSV">1
Chron. xxix, 29</a>).</p>
<p>As Samuel died while David was yet a young man&mdash;four years
before he became king&mdash;he did not record the acts of David. Nathan
and Gad are referred to in the books, but in a manner that forbids the
supposition of their authorship. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb81"
href="#pb81" name="pb81">81</a>]</span>These books were not written by
Samuel; neither were they written by Samuel, Nathan, and Gad. Their
authorship is unknown.</p>
<p>Concerning the books of Samuel, Dr. Oort writes: &ldquo;There is no
book in the Bible which shows so clearly that its contents are not all
derived from the same source&#8202;&hellip;. Two conflicting traditions
relating to the same subject are constantly placed side by side in
perfect simplicity, and apparently with no idea that the one
contradicts the other&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. i, pp. 433,
434).</p>

<h3 class="main">First and Second Kings.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the Catholic version, and in the subtitles of our
versions of the Bible, First and Second Samuel and First and Second
Kings are called the First, Second, Third, and Fourth books of Kings.
They are properly one book. The division of the work into four books is
not only artificial, but illogical. Regarding the authorship of the
last two, Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;As
regards the authorship of the books, but little difficulty presents
itself. The Jewish tradition, which ascribes them to Jeremiah, is borne
out by the strongest internal evidence&rdquo; (Kings).</p>
<p>Is this true? The date assigned for Jeremiah&rsquo;s composition of
the books is 600 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> And yet a considerable
portion of the work is devoted to a presentation of the forty years of
Jewish <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb82" href="#pb82" name=
"pb82">82</a>]</span>history subsequent to this date. It records the
death of Jehoiakim, the first siege and taking of Jerusalem by
Nebuchadnezzar, the elevation of Zedekiah to the throne, his eleven
years&rsquo; reign, the second siege and capture of Jerusalem, and a
long list of events that followed. It records the reign of the
Babylonian king, Evil-Merodach. This, according to the popular
chronology, and according to the &ldquo;Bible Dictionary,&rdquo; was
from 561 to 559 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>&mdash;forty years after
the date assigned, and long after the time of Jeremiah.</p>
<p>These books are a mixture of history and fiction. They profess to be
a history of the Hebrew kings; and yet a dozen chapters are devoted to
a fabulous account of the sayings and doings of two Hebrew prophets,
Elijah and Elisha. First and Second Chronicles, which give a history of
the same kings, refer to Elijah but once, and make no mention of
Elisha.</p>
<p>The confused character of their contents, especially their
chronology, has often been referred to. They are simply a compilation
of ancient documents, written at various times, and by various
authors.</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica expresses the almost unanimous verdict
of critics respecting the authorship of the four principal historical
books of the Old Testament: &ldquo;We cannot speak of the author of
Kings or Samuel, but only of an editor or successive editors whose main
work was to arrange in a continuous form extracts or abstracts from
earlier books.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb83" href="#pb83"

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Isaiah.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Isaiah, the chief of the prophetic books, and, next to
the Pentateuch and the Four Gospels, the most important book of the
Bible, purports to be a series of prophecies uttered during the reigns
of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. Uzziah&rsquo;s reign began
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> 810, and ended <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 758; Hezekiah&rsquo;s reign began <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 726 and ended <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 698.
Isaiah&rsquo;s ministry is supposed to have extended from about 760 to
700 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, and toward the close of this period,
the book of Isaiah, as it now appears, is said to have been
written.</p>
<p>In support of Isaiah&rsquo;s authorship of the entire work the
following arguments have been advanced:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Its various prophecies exhibit a unity of design.</li>
<li>2. The style is the same throughout the work.</li>
<li>3. Messianic prophecies abound in both its parts.</li>
<li>4. No other writer claimed its authorship.</li>
<li>5. The ancient Jews all ascribe it to him.</li>
</ul>
<p>The above arguments for the authenticity of the work are partly true
and partly untrue. So far as they conflict with the following arguments
against its authenticity as a whole they are untrue:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. The work is fragmentary in character.</li>
<li>2. The style of its several parts is quite unlike.</li>
<li>3. Many of its events occurred after Isaiah&rsquo;s
death.<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb84" href="#pb84" name=
"pb84">84</a>]</span></li>
<li>4. Much of it relates to the Babylonian captivity.</li>
<li>5. It records both the name and the deeds of Cyrus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Isaiah might very properly be divided into two books, the first
comprising the first thirty-nine chapters; the second, the concluding
twenty-seven chapters. Impartial critics agree that while Isaiah may
have written a portion of the first part he could not have written all
of it nor any of the second. This is the conclusion of Cheyne,
Davidson, De Wette, Eichorn, Ewald, Gesenius, and others.</p>
<p>That he wrote neither the first nor the second part of the book, as
it now exists, is proven by the following passages taken from both:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Babylon is fallen, is fallen&rdquo; (xxi, 9).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the defensed
cities of Judah, and took them&rdquo; (xxxvi, 1).</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
returned and dwelt in Nineveh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house of
Nishrock his god, that Addrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him
with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia; and
Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead&rdquo; (xxxvii, 37, 38).</p>
<p>Sennacherib ascended the throne 702 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> and
died 680 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> Isaiah lived in the preceding
century.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb85" href="#pb85" name="pb85">85</a>]</span>shall
perform all my pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built,
and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid&rdquo; (xliv, 28).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord to his anointed, to Cyrus&rdquo; (xlv,
1). &ldquo;He shall build my city, and he shall let go my
captives&rdquo; (xlv, 13).</p>
<p>Cyrus conquered Babylon <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 538, and
released the Jews from captivity and permitted them to return and
rebuild Jerusalem and the temple <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 536,
nearly two centuries after the time of Isaiah.</p>
<p>Regarding these passages, Dr. Lyman Abbott, in a sermon on
&ldquo;The Scientific Conception of Revelation,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;If
you take up a history and it refers to Abraham Lincoln, you are
perfectly sure that it was not written in the time of George
Washington. Now, if you take up the book of Isaiah and read in it about
Cyrus the Great, you are satisfied that the book was not written by
Isaiah one hundred years before Cyrus was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof. T. K. Cheyne of Oxford University, the leading modern
authority on Isaiah, says: &ldquo;That portion of the Old Testament
which is known as the book of Isaiah was, in fact, written by at least
three writers&mdash;and possibly many more&mdash;who lived at different
times and in different places.&rdquo; Nearly all of the ninth chapter,
which, on account of its supposed Messianic prophecies, is, with
Christians, one of the most valued chapters of the Bible, Professor
Cheyne declares to be an interpolation. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb86" href="#pb86" name="pb86">86</a>]</span></p>
<p>That four of the middle chapters, the thirty-sixth, thirty-seventh,
thirty-eighth, and thirty-ninth, originally formed a separate document
is evident. Concerning these four chapters, Paine truthfully observes:
&ldquo;This fragment of history begins and ends abruptly; it has not
the least connection with the chapter that precedes it, nor with that
which follows it, nor with any other in the book&rdquo; (Age of Reason,
p. 129).</p>
<p>If Isaiah wrote this book, and Jeremiah wrote the books of Kings, as
claimed; then either Isaiah or Jeremiah was a plagiarist; for the
language of the four chapters just mentioned is, with a few slight
alterations, identical with that of a portion of the second book of
Kings.</p>
<p>The integrity of this book cannot be maintained. It is not the
product of one writer, but of many. How many, critics may never be able
to determine; certainly not less than five, probably more than ten.</p>

<h3 class="main">Jeremiah.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The prophecies of Jeremiah, it is affirmed, were
delivered at various times between 625 and 585 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>, and a final redaction of them was made by him about
the latter date. The book, as it now appears, is in such a disordered
condition that Christian scholars have to separate it into numerous
parts and rearrange them in order to make a consecutive and
intelligible narrative. Dr. Hitchcock, in his &ldquo;Analysis of the
Bible&rdquo; (p 1,144), says: &ldquo;So many changes have taken place,
or else so many irregularities were originally <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb87" href="#pb87" name="pb87">87</a>]</span>admitted
in the arrangement of the book, that Dr. Blayney, whose exposition we
chiefly follow, was obliged to make fourteen different portions of the
whole before he could throw it into consecutive order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The following is Dr. Blayney&rsquo;s arrangement of the book:
Chapters i-xii; xiii-xx; xxii, xxiii; xxv, xxvi; xxxv, xxxvi;
xlv-xlviii; xlix (1&ndash;33); xxi; xxiv; xxvii-xxxiv; xxxvii-xxxix;
xlix (34&ndash;39); l, li; xl-xliv.</p>
<p>This disordered condition of Jeremiah indicates one of two things: a
plurality of authors, or a negligence, if nothing worse, on the part of
the Bible&rsquo;s custodians that Christians will be loath to
acknowledge.</p>
<p>The book, as a whole, was not written by Jeremiah. He did not write
the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the
five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of
Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of
Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of prison&rdquo;
(lii, 31).</p>
<p>The release of Jehoiachin by Evil-Merodach occurred 562 or 561
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> Jeremiah had then been dead twenty
years.</p>
<p>This book is not the work of one author. The thirty-seventh and
thirty-eighth chapters were not written by the same person. Much of the
thirty-eighth is a mere repetition of the thirty-seventh; and yet the
two are so filled with discrepancies <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb88" href="#pb88" name="pb88">88</a>]</span>that it is impossible to
accept both as the writings of the same author.</p>
<p>Jeremiah, it is declared, wrote both Kings and Jeremiah. He could
not have written the concluding portion of either. The last chapter of
2 Kings and the last chapter of Jeremiah are the same, and were written
after the time of Jeremiah.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Ezekiel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The period assigned for Ezekiel&rsquo;s prophecies is
that beginning <span class="sc">B.C.</span> 595 and ending <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> 573. Christians assert that the first twenty-four
chapters of the work were written before the destruction of Jerusalem
by Nebuchadnezzar. The whole work was undoubtedly written after this
event.</p>
<p>The Talmud credits its authorship to the Great Synagogue. If this be
correct, Ezekiel had nothing to do with its composition; for he was not
a member of the Great Synagogue. Ewald, while claiming for him the
utterance of its several prophecies, believes that the book in its
present form is not his work, but that of a later author.</p>
<p>Referring to Ezekiel, Dr. Oort says: &ldquo;In his case, far more
than in Jeremiah&rsquo;s even, we must be on our guard against
accepting the written account of his prophecies as a simple record of
what he actually said&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, vol. ii, p. 407).</p>
<p>Zunz, a German critic, not only contends that the book is not
authentic, but declares that no such prophet as Ezekiel ever existed.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb89" href="#pb89" name=
"pb89">89</a>]</span></p>
<p>While it must be admitted that the internal evidence against the
integrity and authenticity of Ezekiel is weaker than that of the other
books thus far examined, it can be confidently asserted that Bible
apologists have been unable to establish either. One damaging fact they
concede: no other writer of the Bible ever mentions the book or its
alleged author.</p>

<h3 class="main">Minor Prophets.</h3>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The twelve Minor Prophets, Hosea, Joel, Amos, Obadiah,
Jonah, Micah, Nahum, <span class="corr" id="xd26e2968" title=
"Source: Habbakkuk">Habakkuk</span>, Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, and
Malachi, require but a passing notice. Compared with the other
Prophets, or even with the principal books of the Hagiographa, they are
of little importance. A part of them may be genuine&mdash;the writings
of those to whom their authorship has been ascribed&mdash;but there is
no external evidence, either in the Bible or elsewhere, to support the
claim, while the internal evidence of the books themselves is not
convincing.</p>
<p>The date assigned for the composition of Jonah, the oldest of the
Later Prophets, is 856&mdash;according to some, 862 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> He is said to have prophesied during the reign of one
Pul, &ldquo;king of Assyria.&rdquo; But unfortunately Pul&rsquo;s reign
is placed in 770 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, ninety years after the
date assigned for the book. Jonah is named in the Four Gospels, named
by Christ himself. This is adduced as proof of its authenticity and in
support of a literal instead of an allegorical <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb90" href="#pb90" name=
"pb90">90</a>]</span>interpretation of its language. But Christ&rsquo;s
language, even if his divinity be admitted, proves neither the
authenticity nor the historical character of the book. He taught in
parables, and certainly would have no hesitancy in using an allegorical
figure as a symbol. No scholar now contends for its authenticity, and
no sane person believes its stories to be historical. Luther rejected
the book.</p>
<p>Four other books, Hosea, Micah, Zechariah, and Malachi, are quoted
or supposed to be quoted, by the Evangelists, and two, Joel and Amos,
are mentioned in Acts. This proves no more than that these books were
in existence when the New Testament was written&mdash;a fact which none
disputes.</p>
<p>Matthew (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt%202:6&amp;version=NRSV">ii,

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mi%205:2&amp;version=NRSV">v,
ii</a>) as a Messianic prophecy. Micah lived during the reign of
Hezekiah and wrote, not of an event 700 years in the future, but of one
near at hand, the expected invasions of the Assyrians. The passage
quoted by Matthew (ii, 15) from Hosea (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=hos%2011:1&amp;version=NRSV">xi,
1) refers to the exodus of the Israelites which took place 700 years
before the time of Hosea.</a></p>
<p>Zechariah is the work of at least three writers. Davidson says:
&ldquo;To Zechariah&rsquo;s authentic oracles were attached chapters
<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zec%209-14&amp;version=NRSV">

href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=zec%2012-14&amp;version=NRSV">
xii-xiv</a>) belonging to different times and authors&rdquo; (Canon, p.
33). The passage quoted by Matthew (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=mt%2021:5&amp;version=NRSV">xxi,

the spurious chapters, <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

ix, 9</a>. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb91" href="#pb91" name=

<p>Mark (1, 2, 3) quotes a prophecy which he applies to John the
Baptist. The passage quoted contains two sentences, one of which is
found in Malachi (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mal%203:1&amp;version=NRSV">iii,

"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%2040:3&amp;version=NRSV">xl,
3</a>). Whiston declares that both sentences originally belonged to
Isaiah. If Whiston is correct the Evangelist has not quoted Malachi.
This, the last book of the Old Testament, is an anonymous work, Malachi
being the name of the book and not of the author.</p>
<p>The period assigned for the prophecies of Amos is from 808 to 785
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> The book contains the following: &ldquo;In
that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and
close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I
will build it as in the days of old&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am%209:3&amp;version=NRSV">ix,
11</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
and they shall build the waste cities and inhabit them&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am%209:14&amp;version=NRSV">14</a>).</p>
<p>Amos was not written until after the captivity. This commenced 588
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> and continued fifty years.</p>
<p>Joel, it is asserted, was written 800 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
That this writer also lived after the captivity is shown by the
following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall bring again the captivity of Judah and
Jerusalem&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jl%203:1&amp;version=NRSV">iii,
1</a>).</p>
<p>This passage, it is claimed, was a prediction made centuries before
the event occurred. Joel&rsquo;s ability to predict future events,
however, is negatived by his next effort: &ldquo;But Judah <span class=

dwell forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"

<p>The book of Haggai is ascribed to Haggai, the last person in the
world to whom it can reasonably be ascribed. It is not a book <i>of</i>
Haggai, but <i>about</i> Haggai. Excepting a few brief exhortations, of
which it gives an account, it does not purport to contain a word from
his tongue or pen. This argument applies with still greater force to
Jonah.</p>
<p>The greater portion of the Minor Prophets are probably forgeries.
The names of their alleged authors are attached to them, but in most
cases in the form of a superscription only. Each book opens with a
brief introduction announcing the author. These introductions were not
written by the authors themselves, but by others. The only authority
for pronouncing the books authentic, then, is the assurance of some
unknown Jewish scribe or editor. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb93"

<p>A damaging argument against the authority, if not against the
authenticity, of the Prophets is the fact that while the historical
records of the Old Testament cover the time during which all of them
are said to have flourished, only a few of them are deemed worthy of

<h2 class="main">THE HAGIOGRAPHA.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Hagiographa comprises the remaining thirteen books
of the Old Testament. It was divided into three divisions: 1. Psalms,
Proverbs, Job. 2. Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
Esther. 3. Daniel, Ezra and Nehemiah, First and Second Chronicles. The
Jews considered these books of less value than those of the Law and the
Prophets. The books belonging to the third division possess little
merit; but the first two divisions, omitting Esther, together with a
few poems in the Pentateuch and the Prophets, contain the cream of
Hebrew literature.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Psalms.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The collection of hymns and prayers used in public
worship by Jews and Christians, and called the Psalms, stands first in
importance as a religious book in the Hagiographa. Christians accept it
not only as a book of praise, but as a prophetic revelation and
doctrinal authority.</p>
<p>It is popularly supposed that David wrote all, or nearly all, of the
Psalms. Many commentators <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb95" href=
"#pb95" name="pb95">95</a>]</span>attribute to him the authorship of
one hundred or more. He wrote, at the most, but a few of them.</p>
<p>The Jews divided them into five books: 1. Chapters i-xli; 2.
xlii-lxii; 3. lxiii-lxxxix; 4. xc-cvi; 5. cvii-cl. Smith&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Bible Dictionary,&rdquo; a standard orthodox authority, claims
for David the authorship of the first book only. The second book, while
including a few of his psalms, was not compiled, it says, until the
time of Hezekiah, three hundred years after his reign. The psalms of
the third book, it states, were composed during Hezekiah&rsquo;s reign;
those of the fourth book following these, and prior to the Captivity;
and those of the fifth book after the return from Babylon, four hundred
years after David&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>There are psalms in the third, fourth, and fifth books ascribed to
David, but they are clearly of much later origin. The &ldquo;Bible
Dictionary&rdquo; admits that they were not composed by him, and
attempts to account for the Davidic superscription by assuming that
they were written by Hezekiah, Josiah, and others who were lineal
descendants and belonged to the house of David. But there is nothing to
warrant the assumption that they were written by these Jewish kings.
They were anonymous pieces to which the name of David was affixed to
add to their authority.</p>
<p>The second book concludes with these words: &ldquo;The prayers of
David, the son of Jesse, are <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb96" href=
"#pb96" name="pb96">96</a>]</span>ended.&rdquo; This is accepted to
mean that none of the psalms following this book belong to David. The
Korahite psalms, assigned to David&rsquo;s reign, belong to a later
age. Twelve psalms are ascribed to Asaph, who lived in David&rsquo;s
reign. This passage from one of them was written at least 430 years
after David&rsquo;s death:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
temple have they defiled: they have laid Jerusalem on heaps&rdquo;

<p>In the second and third books the word God occurs 206 times, while
Jehovah, translated &ldquo;Lord God,&rdquo; occurs but 44 times; in the
remaining three books, God occurs but 23 times, while Jehovah occurs
640 times.</p>

The Septuagint version and the Alexandrian manuscript contain 151
psalms, the last one being omitted from other versions.</p>
<p>Some of the more conservative German critics credit David with as
many as thirty psalms. Dr. Lyman Abbott contends that he did not write
more than fifteen. The Dutch scholars, Kuenen and Oort, believe that he
wrote none. And this is probably the truth. While collections of these
psalms doubtless existed at an earlier period, the book, in its present
form, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb97" href="#pb97" name=
"pb97">97</a>]</span>was compiled during the Maccabean age, about one
hundred and fifty years before the Christian era.</p>

sentiment.</p>

<h3 class="main">Proverbs.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The authorship of Proverbs has been ascribed to
Solomon. He could have written but few of these proverbs, and probably
wrote none. It is a compilation of maxims made many centuries after his
time. Tradition represented Solomon as the wisest of men, and every
wise saying whose origin was unknown was credited to him.</p>
<p>Dr. Oort says: &ldquo;The history of Solomon&rsquo;s wisdom
resembles that of David&rsquo;s music. In either case the imagination
of posterity has given a thoroughly religious character to what was in
reality purely secular; and just as David was made the author of a
number of psalms, so various works of the so-called sages, or
proverb-makers, were ascribed to Solomon&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
vol. ii, p. 75).</p>
<p>The book consists of seven different collections of proverbs, as
follows: 1. i, 7-ix; 2. x-xxii, 16; 3. xxii, 17-xxiv; 4. xxv-xxix; 5.
xxx; 6. xxxi, 1&ndash;9; 7. xxxi, 10&ndash;31. The first six verses are
a preface.</p>
<p>The first collection, it is admitted, was not the work of Solomon.
These proverbs were composed <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb98" href=
"#pb98" name="pb98">98</a>]</span>as late as 600 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span> The second collection is presented as &ldquo;The
Proverbs of Solomon.&rdquo; If any of Solomon&rsquo;s proverbs exist
they are contained in this collection. The third collection is
anonymous. The fourth begins as follows: &ldquo;These are also proverbs
of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah, king of Judah, copied out&rdquo;
(700 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>). The fifth contains &ldquo;The words
of Agur the son of Jakeh.&rdquo; The sixth, comprising the first nine
verses of the last chapter, are &ldquo;The words of King Lemuel.&rdquo;
The seventh, comprising the remainder of the chapter, is a poem,
written after the Captivity.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Job.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">It is remarkable that the book which, from a literary
point of view, occupies the first place among the books of the Bible,
should be the only one in the collection that was not written by a
believer in the religion of the Bible. It is almost universally
conceded that the book of Job was not written by a Jew, but by a
Gentile.</p>
<p>Most Christians ascribe its authorship to Job himself; but there is
no more authority for ascribing it to Job than there is for ascribing
the Pentateuch to Moses. Job is the name of the leading character of
the book, not the name of its author. Its authorship is unknown. The
Talmud asserts, and probably correctly, that Job was not a real
personage&mdash;that the book is an allegory. Luther says, &ldquo;It is
merely the argument of a fable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding its antiquity, Dr. Hitchcock says: <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb99" href="#pb99" name=
"pb99">99</a>]</span>&ldquo;The first written of all the books in the
Bible, and the oldest literary production in the world, is the book of
Job.&rdquo; The date assigned for its composition is 1520 <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>Had Job been written a thousand years before the time claimed, it
would not be the oldest literary production in the world. But it was
probably written a thousand years after the time claimed. Luther places
its composition 500 years after this time; Renan says that it was
written 800 years later, Ewald and Davidson 900 years later. Grotius
and De Wette believe that it was written 1000 years after the date
assigned, while Hartmann and others contend that it was written still
later. While its exact date cannot be determined, there is internal
evidence pointing to a much later age than that named.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
of the south&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%209:9&amp;version=NRSV">ix,
9</a>).</p>
<p>The use of these Greek astronomical names proves a later origin. So,
too, does the following passage:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chaldeans made out three bands&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%201:17&amp;version=NRSV">i,
17</a>).</p>
<p>Of this people Chambers&rsquo; Encyclopedia says: &ldquo;The
Chaldeans are first heard of in the ninth century before Christ as a
small Accadian tribe on the Persian Gulf.&rdquo; This was seven
centuries after the date assigned for Job, while the same authority
states that Chaldea did not exist until a still later period.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb100" href="#pb100" name=
"pb100">100</a>]</span></p>
<p>The poem of Job, as originally composed, comprised the following:
Chapters i-xxvii, 10; xxviii-xxxi; xxviii-xli, 12; xlii, 1&ndash;6. All
the rest of the book, about eight chapters&mdash;nearly one fifth of
it&mdash;consists of clumsy forgeries. The poet is a radical thinker
who boldly questions the wisdom and justice of God. To counteract the
influence of his work these interpolations which controvert its
teachings were inserted.</p>
<p>Nor is this all. Our translators have still further mutilated the
work. Its most damaging lines they have mistranslated or glossed over.
Thus Job (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jb%2013:15&amp;version=NRSV">xiii,
15</a>) says: &ldquo;He [God] will slay me; I have no hope.&rdquo; Yet
they make him say the very reverse of this: &ldquo;Though he slay me,
yet will I trust in him.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">The Five Rolls.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The second division of the Hagiographa, known as the
Five Rolls, or Megilloth, contains five small books&mdash;The Song of
Solomon, Ecclesiastes, Lamentations, Ruth, and Esther.</p>
<p>The Song of Solomon, Song of Songs, or Canticles, as it is variously
called, and Ecclesiastes, or The Preacher, are said to be the works of
Solomon&mdash;the former a product of his youth, the latter of his old
age. It is quite certain that the same author did not write both, and
equally certain that Solomon wrote neither.</p>
<p>The Song of Solomon, Ewald affirms, is an anonymous poem, written
about the middle of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb101" href="#pb101"
name="pb101">101</a>]</span>the tenth century <span class=
"sc">B.C.</span>.&mdash;after Solomon&rsquo;s time. It is doubtless of
much later origin. It belongs to Northern, and not to Southern
Palestine. This alone proves that Solomon did not write it. The Talmud
says, &ldquo;Hezekiah and his company wrote Isaiah, Proverbs,
Ecclesiastes, and Song of Songs.&rdquo; Hengstenberg, one of the most
orthodox of commentators, says that Ecclesiastes was written centuries
after the time of Solomon. Davidson believes that it was written as
late as 350 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>; while Hartmann and Hitzig,
German critics, contend that it was written still later.</p>
<p>Solomon&rsquo;s Song is an amorous poem, beautiful in its way. But
when we turn to it in the Christian Bible and find the running titles
of every page and the table of contents of every chapter filled with
sanctimonious drivel about Christ and his bride, the Church, we are
reminded of a lecherous parson masquerading under the cloak of piety
among his female parishioners. The Preacher of Ecclesiastes is
something of a Freethought preacher. He is a skeptic and a
philosopher.</p>
<p>Lamentations, it is claimed, was composed by Jeremiah. There is
little evidence either for or against this claim. Oort affirms that its
ascription to Jeremiah is a &ldquo;mistaken tradition,&rdquo; that its
five poems were written by five different authors and at different
times. The habit of ascribing anonymous writings to eminent men was
prevalent among the Jews. Moses, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb102"
href="#pb102" name="pb102">102</a>]</span>Joshua, Samuel, David,
Solomon, Daniel, and probably Jeremiah, have been declared the authors
of books of which they never heard.</p>
<p>Ruth is the only book of the Bible whose authorship is generally
conceded by Christians to be unknown. Dr. Hitchcock says: &ldquo;There
is nothing whatever by which the authorship of it can be
determined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many orthodox scholars admit that Esther&rsquo;s authorship, like
that of Ruth, is unknown. Some credit it to Mordecai. It was written as
late as 300 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>, 150 years after
Mordecai&rsquo;s time. The Vulgate and modern Catholic versions include
six chapters not found in our authorized version. There are many books
in the Bible devoid of truth, but probably none so self-evidently false
as Esther. It has been described as &ldquo;a tissue of glaring
impossibilities from beginning to end.&rdquo; Luther pronounces it a
&ldquo;heathenish extravagance.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Daniel.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christians class Daniel with the Greater Prophets, and
assign its authorship to the sixth century <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
It belongs to the Hagiographa and was one of the last books of the Old
Testament to be written.</p>
<p>A considerable portion of the book relates to Belshazzar. Twenty
times in one chapter is he referred to as the king of Babylon, and five
times is he called the son of Nebuchadnezzar. Yet Belshazzar was not
the son of Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb103" href=
"#pb103" name="pb103">103</a>]</span>neither was he king of Babylon.
Again the author devotes several chapters to Darius &ldquo;the
Median,&rdquo; who, he says, defeated the Chaldeans and conquered
Babylon. Now, nearly everybody, excepting this writer, supposed that it
was Cyrus the Persian who conquered Babylon. Darius &ldquo;the
Median&rdquo; was never king of Babylon. This book was written by one
ignorant of Babylonian history, and not by Daniel, who lived in
Babylon, and who is said to have been next to the king in
authority.</p>
<p>Prof. A. H. Sayce, Professor of Assyriology in Oxford University,
considered by many the greatest of arch&aelig;ologists, a believer in
the divinity of the Bible and an opponent of Higher Criticism, is
compelled to reject Daniel. In a recent article, he says: &ldquo;The
old view of the old Book is correct excepting the book of Daniel, which
is composed of legends&#8202;&hellip;. The historical facts as we know
them from the contemporaneous records are irreconcilable with the
statements found in the historical portions of Daniel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This statement, aside from its rejection of Daniel, is significant.
Here is a man whose life-long study and researches make him
preeminently qualified to judge of one book&rsquo;s authenticity and
credibility. This book he rejects. The books he accepts are those
concerning which he is not specially qualified to judge.</p>
<p>Dr. Arnold says: &ldquo;I have long thought that the greater part of
the book of Daniel is most <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb104" href=
"#pb104" name="pb104">104</a>]</span>certainly a very late work, of the
time of the Maccabees&rdquo; (Life and Correspondence, Vol. II., p.
188). This conclusion of Dr. Arnold&rsquo;s, made seventy years ago, is
confirmed by the later critics who place its composition in the reign
of Antiochus Epiphanes, about 165 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>A part, if not all of the book, was written in Aramaic. In the Greek
version the three small Apocryphal books, History of Susannah, Song of
the Three Holy Children, and Bel and the Dragon, are included in it.
The fact that the Jews placed Daniel in the Hagiographa, instead of the
Prophets, is fatal to the claims regarding its authorship and date.</p>

<h3 class="main">Ezra and Nehemiah.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Ezra and Nehemiah for a time constituted one book,
Ezra. This was afterwards divided into two books and called The First
and Second books of Ezra. Both were ascribed to Ezra. Subsequently the
names were changed to those by which they are now known, and the
authorship assigned respectively to Ezra and Nehemiah. That both were
not composed by the same author is shown by the fact that each contains
a copy of the register of the Jews that returned from Babylon.</p>
<p>Critics agree that Ezra did not write all of the book which now
bears his name&mdash;that it is the work of various authors and was
written, for the most part, long after Ezra&rsquo;s time. A portion of
it was written in Hebrew and the remainder in Aramaic. <span class=

<p>Nehemiah wrote, at the most, but a part of the book ascribed to him.
He did not write the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers; also the priests to the
reign of Darius the Persian&rdquo; (xii, 22).</p>
<p>Darius the Persian began to reign 336 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>;
Nehemiah wrote 433 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;There were in the days of &hellip; Nehemiah the

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=neh%2012:47&amp;version=NRSV">47</a>).</p>
<p>These passages show that the book, as a whole, was not only not
written by Nehemiah, but not until long after the time of Nehemiah.
Spinoza says that both Ezra and Nehemiah were written two or three
hundred years after the time claimed. The later critics are generally
agreed that neither Ezra nor Nehemiah had anything to do with the
composition of these books.</p>

<h3 class="main">First and Second Chronicles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The concluding books of the Hagiographa, and of the
Old Testament, if arranged in their proper order, are First and Second
Chronicles. Theologians tell us that they were written or compiled by
Ezra 456 <span class="sc">B.C.</span></p>
<p>By carefully comparing the genealogy given in the third chapter of 1
Chronicles with that given in the first chapter of Matthew, it will be
seen that the records of Chronicles are brought down to within a few
generations of Jesus. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb106" href=
"#pb106" name="pb106">106</a>]</span>These books are a compilation of
documents made centuries after the time that Ezra and Nehemiah are
supposed to have completed the canon of the Old Testament, and a
hundred years after the date assigned for the Septuagint
translation.</p>
<p>The fragmentary character of many of the books of the Bible, and
particularly of Chronicles, is shown in the conclusion of the second
book. It closes with an unfinished sentence, as follows: &ldquo;The
Lord his God is with him and let him go up&mdash;.&rdquo; The
concluding words may be found in another book of the Bible&mdash;Ezra
(i, 3): &ldquo;To Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of
the Lord God of Israel,&rdquo; etc. The first verses of Ezra are
identical with the last verses of Chronicles. The compiler of
Chronicles had seemingly begun to copy the document which now forms a
part of the book of Ezra, and in the middle of a sentence was suddenly
called away from his work, never to resume and complete it.</p>
<p>We have now reviewed the books of the Old Testament. We have seen
that the claims made in support of their authenticity are, for the most
part, either untrue or incapable of proof. When and by whom Genesis,
Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Ruth, First

<h2 class="main">THE FOUR GOSPELS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The lesser in size but the greater in importance of
the two divisions of the Bible is the New Testament. The principal
books of the New Testament, and the most highly valued by Christians of
all the books of the Bible, are the Four Gospels. These books, it is
affirmed, were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, in the first
century; Matthew between 37 and 50, Mark and Luke between 56 and 63,
and John between 78 and 97 <span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p>The orthodox claims regarding the origin of these books are thus
expressed by Dr. Hitchcock:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Four Gospels are the best authenticated ancient writings
in the world; so clear, weighty, and extensive is the mass of testimony
in favor of them&rdquo; (Analysis of the Bible, p. 1149).</p>
<p>&ldquo;These four books, together constituting the best attested
piece of history in the world, were written by four eye-witnesses of

<p>&ldquo;Matthew and John were Apostles and Mark and Luke were
companions and disciples of Apostles&rdquo; (Ibid). <span class=

<p>If these books are authentic and divinely inspired, as claimed,
Christianity is built upon a rock, and the floods and winds of adverse
criticism will beat against it in vain; but if they are not
authentic&mdash;if they were not written by the Evangelists
named&mdash;if they are merely anonymous books, written one hundred and
fifty years after the events they purport to record, as many contend,
then it is built upon the sand and must fall.</p>

<p class="first">Christians claim to have an &ldquo;unbroken chain of
testimony&rdquo; to the genuineness and credibility of the Four Gospels
from the alleged dates of their composition down to the present time. I
shall endeavor to show that they have no such chain of
testimony&mdash;that the most important part of it is wanting.</p>
<p>Twenty books&mdash;all of the remaining books of the New Testament
but three&mdash;are ascribed to the Apostles Paul, Peter, and John. All
of these books, it is affirmed, were written after Matthew was written,
and about one-half of them after Mark and Luke were written. If this be
true, some proofs of the existence of the Synoptic Gospels ought to be
found in these books.</p>
<p>Of the fourteen Epistles credited to Paul all have been assigned
later dates than Matthew, and a portion of them later dates than Mark
and Luke. But there is not a word to indicate that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb110" href="#pb110" name="pb110">110</a>]</span>any
one of these Gospels was in existence when Paul wrote.</p>
<p>The two Epistles of Peter, it is claimed, were written after
Matthew, Mark, and Luke were written. But these Epistles contain no
mention of them.</p>
<p>The four remaining books, First, Second, and Third John and
Revelation, are said to have been written after these Gospels were
composed. Their reputed author, however, knows nothing of these
gospels.</p>
<p>The three great Apostles are silent&mdash;three links at the very
beginning of this chain are missing.</p>

<h3 class="main">The Apostolic Fathers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">After the Apostles, and contemporary with the oldest
of them, come the Apostolic Fathers, Clement of Rome, Ignatius, and
Polycarp. Clement wrote about the close of the first century. There are
two Epistles credited to him, but in these Epistles are to be found no
evidences of the existence of the Four Gospels.</p>
<p>Ignatius is said to have suffered martyrdom in the year 116. There
are fifteen Epistles which bear his name. A few of these are believed
to be genuine, while the remainder are conceded to be forgeries. But in
none of them, neither in the genuine nor in the spurious, is there any
evidence that the Gospels had appeared when they were written.</p>
<p>Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna, who is said to <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb111" href="#pb111" name="pb111">111</a>]</span>have
been the companion of John, died at a very advanced age, about the year
167. His Epistle to the Philippians is extant, but it contains no
reference to the Gospels.</p>
<p>Hermas and Barnabas are usually classed with the Apostolic Fathers.
The Shepherd of Hermas and the Epistle of Barnabas make no mention of
the Evangelists.</p>
<p>That the writings of the Apostolic Fathers contain no proofs of the
existence of the Four Gospels is admitted even by Christian writers.
Dr. Westcott admits it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reference in the sub-apostolic age to the discourses or
actions of our Lord, as we find them recorded in the Gospels, show, as
far as they go, that what the Gospels relate was then held to be true;
but it does not necessarily follow that they were already in use, and
were the actual source of the passages in question. On the contrary,
the mode in which Clement refers to our Lord&rsquo;s
teaching&mdash;&lsquo;the Lord said,&rsquo; not
&lsquo;saith&rsquo;&mdash;seems to imply that he was indebted to
tradition, and not to any written accounts, for words most closely
resembling those which are still found in our Gospels. The main
testimony of the Apostolic Fathers is, therefore, to the substance, and
not to the authenticity of the Gospels&rdquo; (On the Canon of the New
Testament, p. 52).</p>
<p>Bishop Marsh makes the following admission: &ldquo;From the Epistle
of Barnabas, no inference can be deduced that he had read any part of
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb112" href="#pb112" name=
"pb112">112</a>]</span>the New Testament. From the genuine Epistle, as
it is called, of Clement of Rome, it may be inferred that Clement had
read the First Epistle to the Corinthians. From the Shepherd of Hermas
no inference whatsoever can be drawn. From the Epistles of Ignatius it
may be concluded that he had read St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to the
Ephesians, and that there existed in his time evangelical writings,
though it cannot be shown that he has quoted them. From
Polycarp&rsquo;s Epistle to the Philippians it appears that he had
heard of St. Paul&rsquo;s Epistle to that community, and he quotes a
passage which is in the First Epistle to the Corinthians and another
which is in the Epistle to the Ephesians; but no positive conclusion
can be drawn with respect to any other epistle, or any of the Four
Gospels&rdquo; (Michaelis, Vol. I., p. 354).</p>
<p>Dr. Dodwell says: &ldquo;We have at this day certain most authentic
ecclesiastical writers of the times, as Clemens Romanus, Barnabas,
Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, who wrote in the order wherein I have
named them, and after all the writers of the New Testament. But in
Hermas you will not find one passage or any mention of the New
Testament, nor in all the rest is any one of the Evangelists
named&rdquo; (Dissertations upon Iren&aelig;us).</p>
<p>Professor Norton says: &ldquo;When we endeavor to strengthen this
evidence by appealing to the writings ascribed to Apostolic Fathers we,
in fact, weaken its force. At the very extremity of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb113" href="#pb113" name="pb113">113</a>]</span>the
chain of evidence, where it ought to be strongest, we are attaching
defective links which will bear no weight&rdquo; (Genuineness of the
Gospels, Vol I., p. 357).</p>
<p>Clement, Ignatius, and Polycarp, all refer to the Epistles of Paul,
showing that they were in existence when they wrote and that they were
acquainted with them. But they never mention the Four Gospels, and this
silence affords conclusive evidence that these books as authoritative
documents did not exist in their time; for it is unreasonable to
suppose that they would use the least important and make no use of the
most important books of the New Testament. Three additional and three
of the principal links in this &ldquo;unbroken chain of
testimony&rdquo; are wanting, and must be supplied before the
authenticity of the Four Gospels can be established.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Christian Fathers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The early Christian Fathers had no knowledge of the
existence of the Four Gospels. One of the earliest and one of the most
eminent of the Christian Fathers was Justin Martyr. He lived and wrote
about the middle of the second century. His writings are rather
voluminous, and are devoted to the task of proving to both Jews and
Gentiles the divinity of Christ and the divine origin of Christianity.
If a Christian writer were to attempt to demonstrate this now, where
would he go for his authority? To the Four Gospels. These would
constitute his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb114" href="#pb114" name=
"pb114">114</a>]</span>chief&mdash;almost his entire authority. Now,
had these books been extant when Justin wrote, and valued as they are
by Christians to-day, he would have used them, he would have quoted
from them, he would have named them. But he makes no use of them, he
never mentions them. He makes more than three hundred quotations from
the Old Testament&mdash;Messianic prophecies, etc.&mdash;and in nearly
two hundred instances he names the books from which he quotes. He makes
nearly one hundred quotations from Christian writings that are now
considered apocryphal, but he makes none from the Four Gospels.</p>
<p>This silence of Justin is the most damaging argument that has been
adduced against the authenticity of the Gospels. This demonstrates one
of two things: that these books were not in existence when Justin
Martyr wrote, were not in existence at the middle of the second
century, or if they were, the foremost Christian scholar of his age
rejected them.</p>
<p>Recognizing the significance of this damaging fact, Christian
apologists have attempted to show that Justin was acquainted with our
Gospels by citing extracts from his writings similar to passages found
in them. Westcott adduces seven passages, but admits that two only are
wholly identical. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the seven, five agree verbally with the text of St.
Matthew or St. Luke, exhibiting, indeed, three slight various readings
not elsewhere <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb115" href="#pb115" name=
"pb115">115</a>]</span>found, but such as are easily explicable. The
sixth is a condensed summary of words related by St. Matthew; the
seventh alone presents an important variation in the text of a verse,
which is, however, otherwise very uncertain&rdquo; (Canon of the New
Testament, p. 131).</p>
<p>Think of this renowned defender of Christianity, Justin Martyr,
attempting to establish the divinity of Christ by citing four hundred
texts from the Old Testament and apocryphal books and two only from the
Evangelists!</p>
<p>There is really but one passage in the Gospels to be found in
Justin. But if it could be shown that they contain many passages
similar to, or even identical with, passages found in his writings,
this would not prove that he has quoted from them. It is not claimed
that these Gospels are mere fabrications of their authors, or that they
are composed entirely of original matter. They consist largely of
traditions, and these traditions, many of them, were embodied in other
and older books which were used by the early Fathers. While the Four
Gospels were not extant in Justin&rsquo;s time, some of the documents
of which they are composed, particularly those containing the reputed
sayings of Jesus, had already appeared and were frequently cited by the
Fathers. These citations, Paley, Lardner, Westcott, and others, in
their evidences of Christianity, have adduced as proofs of the early
origin of the Four Gospels.</p>
<p>Justin&rsquo;s quotations are chiefly from what he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb116" href="#pb116" name=
"pb116">116</a>]</span>calls the &ldquo;Memoirs of the Apostles.&rdquo;
These, it is claimed, were the Four Gospels.<a id="xd26e3402" name=
"xd26e3402"></a> If so, then the gospels we have are not genuine, for
the quotations from the &ldquo;Memoirs&rdquo; are not to be found in
our Gospels. Justin says that Mary (not Joseph) was descended from
David; that Jesus was born in a cave; that the Magi came from Arabia;
that Jesus made ploughs and yokes; that a fire was kindled in the
Jordan at his baptism; that he was called a magician. The
&ldquo;Memoirs,&rdquo; or Gospels, from which Justin quotes are not our
Gospels.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Giles repudiates the claim that Justin Martyr
recognized the Gospels. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The very names of the Evangelists, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
John, are never mentioned by him&mdash;do not occur once in all his
works. It is, therefore, childish to say that he has quoted from our
existing Gospels&rdquo; (Christian Records, p. 71).</p>
<p>Papias, a Christian bishop and a contemporary of Justin Martyr, is
cited as a witness for the Gospels. He is quoted by Eusebius as
referring to writings of Matthew and Mark. But the books he mentions
are plainly not the gospels of Matthew and Mark.</p>
<p>Of Matthew he says: &ldquo;Matthew composed the oracles in the
Hebrew dialect, and every one interpreted them as he was able&rdquo;
(Eusebius&rsquo; Ecclesiastical History, book iii, p. 39).</p>
<p>This was not the biographical narrative known as
&ldquo;Matthew,&rdquo; but probably an apocryphal <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb117" href="#pb117" name="pb117">117</a>]</span>book
called the &ldquo;Oracles of Christ,&rdquo; which some ascribed to
Matthew.</p>
<p>Mark is referred to as follows: &ldquo;Mark having become the
interpreter of Peter, wrote accurately whatever he remembered, though
he did not arrange in order the things which were either said or done
by Christ. For he neither heard the Lord, nor followed him; but
afterwards, as I said, accompanied Peter, who adapted his teaching to
the occasion, and not as making a consecutive record of the
Lord&rsquo;s discourses&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History, book iii, p.
39).</p>
<p>This does not describe our Gospel of Mark, which, although a
compilation, is a consecutive narrative of events, and not a collection
of isolated fragments.</p>
<p>But even if Papias was acquainted with the Gospels, he is a poor
witness to their credibility, for he accepted the teachings of
tradition in preference to the books which he knew: &ldquo;I held that
what was to be derived from books did not profit me as that from the
living and abiding voice [tradition]&rdquo; (Ecclesiastical History,
iii, 39).</p>
<p>Dr. Davidson admits that the books mentioned by Papias were not our
Gospels. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papias speaks of Matthew and Mark, but it is most probable
that he had documents which either formed the basis of our present
Matthew and Mark or were taken into them and written over&rdquo; (Canon
of the Bible, p. 124). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb118" href=
"#pb118" name="pb118">118</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;He neither felt the want nor knew the existence of inspired
Gospels&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 123).</p>
<p>The writings of thirty Christian authors who wrote prior to 170 are
still extant. In all these writings there is to be found no mention of
the Four Gospels.</p>
<p>In the writings of Theophilus, bishop of Antioch, occurs the
following: &ldquo;John says: &lsquo;In the beginning was the Word, and
the Word was God.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo; This was written in 180, after
the middle of the latter half of the second century, and is the
earliest proof of the existence of any one of the Four Gospels.</p>
<p>Iren&aelig;us, bishop of Lyons, who wrote about 190, is the earliest
writer who mentions all of the Four Gospels. He names them; he declares
them to be inspired; he makes four hundred quotations from them. The
Four Gospels were in existence when Iren&aelig;us wrote, and they were
undoubtedly composed between the time of Justin Martyr and the time of
Iren&aelig;us&mdash;that is, some time during the latter half of the
second century.</p>
<p>Writers on the evidences of Christianity endeavor to establish the
genuineness of the Four Gospels by showing that the Fathers who lived
and wrote during the two centuries following the ministry and death of
Jesus accepted and quoted them as authorities. They credit these
Fathers with more than four thousand evangelical quotations. But where
are these quotations to be found? Nearly all of them in Iren&aelig;us,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb119" href="#pb119" name=
"pb119">119</a>]</span>Clemens of Alexandria, Tertullian, and Origen,
while in Clement of Rome, Ignatius, Polycarp, and Justin Martyr few or
none are claimed. The fact that the writings of the Fathers which
appeared immediately after 180 contain thousands of evangelical
references, while in all the writings which appeared before 170 the
evangelists are not even named, affords conclusive evidence that the
Four Gospels were composed during or near the decade that elapsed
between 170 and 180 <span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Four Gospels do not claim to have been composed by
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The titles are not &ldquo;The Gospel of
Matthew,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gospel of Mark,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gospel of
Luke,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Gospel of John,&rdquo; but &ldquo;The
Gospel According to Matthew,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gospel According to
Mark,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Gospel According to Luke,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The
Gospel According to John.&rdquo; The titles simply imply that they are
according to the real or traditional teachings of these Evangelists. So
far as the textual authorship is concerned, they are, and do not
purport to be other than, anonymous books. Omit these titles, and not
one word remains to indicate their authorship. Now, it is admitted that
these books did not originally bear these titles. St. Chrysostom, who
believes that they are genuine, says (Homilies i) that the authors did
not place their names at the head of their Gospels, but that
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb120" href="#pb120" name=
"pb120">120</a>]</span>this was afterward done by the church. There is
nothing in them to support the claim that they were written by those
whose names have been prefixed. On the contrary, their contents furnish
conclusive proofs that they were not written by these supposed authors,
nor in the apostolic age.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Matthew.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Christians believe that Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel was
written in Hebrew. Our Matthew was written in Greek. An attempt has
been made to explain the discrepancy by assuming that Matthew wrote his
book in Hebrew, and subsequently rewrote it in Greek, or translated it
into this language. But another difficulty remains. The quotations from
the Old Testament in Matthew, and there are many, are taken, not from
the Hebrew, but from the Septuagint (Greek) version. This proves that
it was originally written in Greek and not in Hebrew.</p>
<p>The Gospel According to the Hebrews, it is affirmed, was the Hebrew
form of Matthew. If this be true, then our Greek Matthew cannot be a
correct translation, for the passages from the Gospel of the Hebrews
which have been preserved are not to be found in Matthew. The following
quotations are from the Gospel of the Hebrews, this supposed original
Gospel of Matthew:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He who wonders shall reign, and he who reigns shall
rest.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb121" href="#pb121" name=
"pb121">121</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the rich man began to smite his head, and it pleased him
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Holy Ghost, my mother, lately took me by one of my hairs,
and bore me to the great mountain Tabor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a mason, who get my livelihood by my hands; I beseech
thee, Jesus, that thou wouldst restore to me my strength, that I may no
longer thus scandalously beg my bread.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If these passages are from the original Gospel of Matthew, then the
accepted Gospel of Matthew is spurious.</p>
<p>This Hebrew Gospel was the Gospel of the Ebionites and Nazarenes.
Eusebius says: &ldquo;They [the Ebionites] made use only of that which
is called the Gospel According to the Hebrews.&rdquo; Epiphanius says:
&ldquo;They [the Nazarenes] have the Gospel of Matthew most entire in
the Hebrew language.&rdquo; St. Jerome refers to it as &ldquo;the
Gospel which the Nazarenes and Ebionites use.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Referring to these sects, Dr. Hug, the eminent Catholic critic,
says: &ldquo;The Ebionites denied the miraculous conception of Christ,
and, with the Nazarenes, looked upon him only as an ordinary
man.&rdquo; The Gospel which these sects accepted as their authority
could not have been our Gospel of Matthew, because the most important
part of this Gospel is the story of the miraculous conception.</p>
<p>While the claim that Matthew wrote his Gospel in Hebrew is
vigorously maintained, the claim that he afterwards translated it into
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb122" href="#pb122" name=
"pb122">122</a>]</span>Greek himself is so manifestly untenable that
many have conceded its improbability. Jerome says: &ldquo;Who
afterwards translated it [Matthew] into Greek is not sufficiently
certain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The consequences of this admission are thus reluctantly expressed by
Michaelis: &ldquo;If the original text of Matthew is lost, and we have
nothing but a Greek translation: then, frankly, we cannot ascribe any
divine inspiration to the words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two texts may be cited from Matthew which prove a later date for the
Gospel than that claimed. Jesus, in upbraiding the Jews, is reported to
have used the following language:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the
earth, from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias,
son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2023:35&amp;version=NRSV">xxiii,
35</a>).</p>
<p>Zacharias, the son of Baruch (Barouchos), who is undoubtedly meant,
was slain in the temple about 69 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> Thus
Matthew makes Jesus refer to an event that occurred forty years after
his death and twenty or thirty years after the Gospel of Matthew is
said to have been written.</p>
<p>Dr. Hug admits that this is the Zacharias referred to. He says:
&ldquo;There cannot be a doubt, if we attend to the name, the fact and
its circumstances, and the object of Jesus in citing it, that it was
the same Zacharias Barouchos, who, according to Josephus, a short time
before the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb123" href="#pb123" name=
"pb123">123</a>]</span>destruction of Jerusalem, was unjustly slain in
the temple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding this passage in Matthew, Professor Newman, of University
College, London, says: &ldquo;There is no other man known in history to
whom this verse can allude. If so, it shows how late, how ignorant, how
rash, is the composer of a text passed off on us as sacred truth&rdquo;
(Religion Not History, p. 46).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church;
and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give
unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt
bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose
on earth shall be loosed in heaven&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt%2016:18-19&amp;version=NRSV">xvi,
18, 19</a>).</p>
<p>This passage was written at the beginning of the establishment of
the Roman Catholic hierarchy, for the purpose of securing the
recognition of the Church of Rome (the founding of which tradition
assigned to Peter) as <i>the</i> church of Christ.</p>
<p>Bishop Marsh, in his Michaelis, says: &ldquo;If the arguments in
favor of a late date for the composition of St. Matthew&rsquo;s Gospel
be compared with those in favor of an early date, it will be found that
the former greatly outweigh the latter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Davidson admits that Matthew is an anonymous work. He says:
&ldquo;The author, indeed, must ever remain unknown&rdquo;
(Introduction to the New Testament, p. 72). <span class=

<h3 class="main">Mark.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">As to where the Gospel of Mark was written, whether in
Asia, in Africa, or in Europe, is unknown. Some believe that it was
written at Antioch; Chrysostom states that it was written at
Alexandria; Iren&aelig;us says that it was written at Rome. If it was
written at Rome it was probably written in Latin instead of Greek.
Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; concedes that &ldquo;it
abounds in Latin words.&rdquo; The following is an example:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he asked him, What is thy name? And he answered, saying,
My name is Legion: for we are many&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mk%205:9&amp;version=NRSV">v.
9</a>).</p>
<p>Commenting on this passage, the Rev. Dr. Giles says: &ldquo;The Four
Gospels are written in Greek, and the word &lsquo;legion&rsquo; is
Latin; but in Galilee and Perea the people spoke neither Latin nor
Greek, but Hebrew, or a dialect of it. The word &lsquo;legion&rsquo;
would be perfectly unintelligible to the disciples of Christ, and to
almost everybody in the country&rdquo; (Christian Records, p. 197).</p>
<p>If it was written in Latin, then our Greek Mark, like Matthew,
instead of being an original Gospel, is simply an unauthenticated
translation.</p>
<p>Mark has generally been considered a Petrine Gospel; orthodox
Christians claiming that Peter dictated the Gospel to Mark. Discussing
this claim, the author of &ldquo;Supernatural Religion&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;Throughout the Gospel there is the total absence of anything
which is specially characteristic <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb125"
href="#pb125" name="pb125">125</a>]</span>of Petrine influence and
teaching&rdquo; (Vol. I., p. 362). Volkmar and others declare it to be
Pauline. One thing can be affirmed with certainty; it was not written
by John Mark, neither was it dictated by Peter.</p>
<p>The last twelve verses of Mark, it is claimed, are an interpolation,
because they are not to be found in the older manuscripts of the book.
The Revision Committee which prepared the New Version of the New
Testament pronounced them spurious. If these verses are not genuine,
then it must be admitted that the second Gospel is either an unfinished
or a mutilated work; for with these verses omitted, it ends abruptly
with the visit of the women to the tomb, leaving the most important
events at the close of Christ&rsquo;s career, his appearance and
ascension&mdash;the proofs of his resurrection&mdash;unrecorded.</p>
<p>The greater portion of Mark is to be found in Matthew and Luke, and
much of it in the same or similar language. Judge Waite, in his review
of the Gospel, says: &ldquo;Mark has almost a complete parallel in Luke
and Matthew taken together. There are but 24 verses which have no
parallel in either of the other synoptics&rdquo; (History of
Christianity, p. 350).</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of Mark, Strauss says: &ldquo;Our second Gospel
cannot have originated from recollections of Peter&rsquo;s
instructions, <i>i. e.</i>, from a source peculiar to itself, since it
is evidently a compilation, whether made from memory or <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb126" href="#pb126" name=
"pb126">126</a>]</span>otherwise, from the first and third
Gospels&rdquo; (Life of Jesus, Vol. I., p. 51).</p>
<p>That neither Peter nor Mark had anything to do with the composition
of this book is admitted by Davidson. Referring to it he says:
&ldquo;It has therefore no relation to the Apostle, and derives no
sanction from his name. The author is unknown&rdquo; (Introduction to
New Testament, Vol. II, p. 84).</p>

<h3 class="main">Luke.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In denying the authenticity of Mark and Luke, what I
deny is that these books were written by the traditional Mark and Luke,
the companions of Peter and Paul. I deny that they were written in the
apostolic age and by apostolic authority. As stated by
&ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopedia,&rdquo; &ldquo;the question as to
their genuineness is in the main question as to the fact of their
existence at this early period; the special authorship of each Gospel
is a comparatively less important question.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book of Luke is anonymous; it does not claim to be written by
Luke. And yet the Fathers may have been correct in ascribing its
authorship to him. If so, who was this Luke? Where did he live? When
did he write his book? &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s&rdquo; says he
&ldquo;was born, according to the accounts of the Church Fathers, at
Antioch, in Syria.&rdquo; Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo;
says, &ldquo;He was born at Antioch.&rdquo; The Gospel is addressed to
Theophilus. Who was Theophilus? The &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo;
says: <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb127" href="#pb127" name=
"pb127">127</a>]</span>&ldquo;From the honorable epithet applied to him
in <a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lk%201:3&amp;version=NRSV">
Luke i, 3</a>, it has been argued with much probability that he was a
person in high official position.&rdquo; There is but one Theophilus
known to history to whom the writer can possibly refer, and this is
Theophilus, Bishop of Antioch, who lived in the latter part of the
second century. Luke and Theophilus, then, both belonged to Antioch,
and it is undoubtedly to this Theophilus that Luke&rsquo;s Gospel is
addressed. This proves that it was written more than one hundred years
after the date assigned for its composition. When Luke assumed the task
of writing a Gospel, Matthew, it has been claimed, was the only Gospel
extant. And yet Luke in his introduction declares that many had been
written; all of which he admits were genuine. Jerome says that one of
the Gospels which Luke refers to was the Gospel of Appelles: &ldquo;The
Evangelist, Luke, declares that there were many who wrote
Gospels&#8202;&hellip;. They were such as that according to the
Egyptians, and Thomas, and Matthias, and Bartholomew, that of the
Twelve Apostles, and Basilides, and Appelles, and others.&rdquo; The
Gospel of Appelles was written about 60 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> If
Luke&rsquo;s Gospel was written after the Gospel of Appelles, it was
written after the middle of the second century.</p>
<p>Dr. Schleiermacher, one of the greatest of modern theologians,
maintains that Luke is a compilation of thirty-three different
manuscripts; as follows: Chapter i, 1&ndash;4; i, 5&ndash;80; ii,
1&ndash;20; ii, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb128" href="#pb128"

<p>Bishop Thirlwall&rsquo;s Schleiermacher contains the following in
regard to the composition of Luke: &ldquo;The main position is firmly
established that Luke is neither an independent writer, nor has made a
compilation from works which extended over the whole course of the life
of Jesus. He is from beginning to end no more than the compiler and
arranger of documents which he found in existence, and which he allows
to pass unaltered through his hands&rdquo; (p. 313).</p>
<p>The immediate source of Luke&rsquo;s Gospel was undoubtedly the
Gospel of Marcion, itself a compilation of older documents. Referring
to this Gospel, the Rev. S. Baring-Gould says: &ldquo;The arrangement
is so similar that we are forced to the conclusion that it was either
used by St. Luke or that it was his original composition. If he used
it, then his right to the title of author of the Third Gospel falls to
the ground, as what he added was of small amount&rdquo; (Lost and
Hostile Gospels).</p>

<p>The theory that the Synoptics borrowed from each other will account
for the agreements in their books; but it will not account for the
disagreements, and these are quite as numerous as the agreements. The
following hypothesis, however, will account for both. When the
Synoptics were composed probably fifty gospels, some of recent and
others of early origin, were already in existence. In addition to these
were a hundred other documents pertaining to Christ and his teachings.
From this mass of Gospel literature the Synoptics were compiled. Those
portions that agree were taken from a common source; those that do not
agree were taken from different documents.</p>
<p>Dean Alford believes that in the early ages of the church there
existed what he terms a &ldquo;common substratum of apostolic
teachings,&rdquo; &ldquo;oral or partially documentary.&rdquo; This, he
says, &ldquo;I believe to have been the original source of the common
part of our three Gospels.&rdquo; Canon Westcott admits that
&ldquo;their substance is evidently much older than their
form.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Ladd, of Yale College, says: &ldquo;In some respects each
of the first three Gospels must be regarded as a compilation; it
consists <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb131" href="#pb131" name=
"pb131">131</a>]</span>of material which the others have in common with
it, and which was of a traditional kind more or less prepared before
the author of the particular Gospel took it in hand to modify and
rearrange it&rdquo; (What Is the Bible? p. 295).</p>
<p>Bishop Marsh, in his Michaelis, says: &ldquo;The notion of an
absolute independence, in respect to the composition of our three first
Gospels, is no longer tenable&rdquo; (Vol. III, part 2, p. 170).</p>
<p>Prof. Robertson Smith, of Scotland, pronounces them
&ldquo;unapostolic digests of the second century.&rdquo; Evanson goes
further and declares them to be &ldquo;spurious fictions of the second
century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Encyclopedia Britannica concedes the fact that Protestant
scholarship in Europe has virtually abandoned the popular orthodox
position regarding the origin of these books. It says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is certain that the Synoptic Gospels took their present
form only by degrees, and that while they have their root in the
apostolic age, they are fashioned by later influences and adapted to
special wants in the early church. They are the deposits, in short, of
Christian traditions handed down first of all in an oral form, before
being committed to writing in such a form as we have them; and this is
now an accepted conclusion of every historical school of theologians in
England no less than in Germany, conservative no less than
radical.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">John.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In addition to what has already been adduced
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb132" href="#pb132" name=
"pb132">132</a>]</span>against the Johannine authorship of the Fourth
Gospel, I submit the following:</p>
<p>1. John, the disciple of Jesus, was an unlettered fisherman. The
author of the Fourth Gospel was an accomplished scholar and a polished
writer. His book is one of the classics of Christian literature.</p>
<p>2. The Apostle John was born at Bethsaida. The author of John says
that Bethsaida was in Galilee (xii, 21). Bethsaida was not in Galilee,
but in Perea, and to assert that John wrote this Gospel is to assert
that he was ignorant of the location of his own town.</p>
<p>3. &ldquo;In Bethany beyond Jordan&rdquo; (New Ver. <a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%201:28&amp;version=NRSV">
i, 28</a>). &ldquo;In Enon near to Salim&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%203:23&amp;version=NRSV">iii,
23</a>). &ldquo;A city of Samaria, called Sychar&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%204:5&amp;version=NRSV">iv,
5</a>). These passages were written by one little acquainted with the
geography of Palestine and unfamiliar with the scenes he attempts to
describe.</p>
<p>4. John, the son of Zebedee, was a Jew. The manner in which the
author of the Fourth Gospel always refers to the Jews is conclusive
evidence that he was not a Jew.</p>
<p>5. The Synoptics state that Jesus celebrated the Passover with his
disciples, and was crucified on the following day. The author of John
states that he was crucified on the previous day, and therefore did not
partake of the Paschal supper. In the second century a great
controversy arose in the church regarding this. Those who accepted the
account given in the Synoptics observed the feast, while those who
accepted <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb133" href="#pb133" name=
"pb133">133</a>]</span>the account given in the Fourth Gospel rejected
it. Now, we have the testimony of Iren&aelig;us that John himself
observed this feast. &ldquo;For neither could Anicetus persuade
Polycarp not to observe it, because he had ever observed it with John,
the disciple of our Lord&rdquo; (Against Heresies, iii, 3). As John
accepted the account which appears in the Synoptics and rejected that
which appears in the Gospel of John, he could not have written the
Fourth Gospel.</p>
<p>6. The disciple John is represented as standing at the cross and
witnessing the crucifixion. The author of John does not claim to have
been present, but appeals to the testimony of an eye-witness in support
of his statements: &ldquo;And he that saw it bare record, and his
record is true&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:35&amp;version=NRSV">xix,
35</a>).</p>
<p>7. &ldquo;Now, there was leaning on Jesus&rsquo; bosom one of his
disciples whom he loved&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2013:23&amp;version=NRSV">xiii,
23</a>). &ldquo;The disciple standing by, whom he loved&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2019:26&amp;version=NRSV">xix,
26</a>). &ldquo;To Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus
loved&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:2&amp;version=NRSV">xx,
2</a>). This beloved disciple is said to be John. The Synoptics,
however, do not represent John as the favorite disciple. If there was
one disciple whom Jesus loved more than the others, it was Peter. To
ascribe to John the authorship of the Fourth Gospel is to ascribe to
him a spirit of self-glorification that is simply disgusting.</p>
<p>8. &ldquo;And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of
his disciples, which are not <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb134" href=
"#pb134" name="pb134">134</a>]</span>written in this book: but these
are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of
God: and that believing ye might have life through his name&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jn%2020:30-31&amp;version=NRSV">xx,
30, 31</a>). Thus concludes the original Gospel According to St. John.
This book was not written by John, but it was written by a disciple of
John for Johannine Christians. When the Roman Catholic hierarchy was
formed and the Gospel of John was admitted to the New Testament canon,
there was appended another chapter&mdash;a forgery. The hero of this
chapter is Peter. A dozen times Jesus calls him by name. To him Jesus
gives the oft repeated injunction, &ldquo;Feed my lambs;&rdquo;
&ldquo;feed my sheep.&rdquo; This chapter was added to counteract the
Johannine influence and exalt the Petrine teachings so dear to Rome. To
give an appearance of genuineness to this forgery, &ldquo;the disciple
whom Jesus loved&rdquo; is again introduced and declared the author of
the Gospel, thus making John himself a supporter of Petrine
supremacy.</p>
<p>9. Some of the most important events in the life of Jesus, the
Synoptics state, were witnessed by John. The author of the Fourth
Gospel knows nothing about them. &ldquo;All the events said to have
been witnessed by John alone are omitted by John alone. This fact seems
fatal either to the reality of the events in question or to the
genuineness of the Fourth Gospel&rdquo; (Greg).</p>
<p>10. Even Christians have tacitly admitted the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb135" href="#pb135" name=
"pb135">135</a>]</span>hopelessness of maintaining the authenticity of
both the Fourth Gospel and the Synoptics. If the Synoptics are
authentic, the Fourth Gospel cannot be. Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible
Dictionary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;In the Fourth Gospel the narrative
coincides with that of the other three in a few passages only. Putting
aside the account of the Passion, there are only three facts which John
relates in common with the other Evangelists&rdquo; (Art. Gospels).</p>
<p>11. The author of John declares Jesus to be God. The complete
deification of Jesus was the growth of generations. The early
Christians, including the Apostles, believed him to be a man. Later, he
became a demi-god, and the writings and traditions which represented
him as such formed the materials from which the Synoptics were
compiled. Not until the latter part of the second century was Jesus
placed among the gods, and not until this time was the Fourth Gospel
written.</p>
<p>Alluding to the Fourth Gospel, Canon Westcott says: &ldquo;The
earliest account of the origin of the Gospel is already
legendary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Davidson says: &ldquo;The Johannine authorship has receded
before the tide of modern criticism, and though this tide is arbitrary
at times it is here irresistible&rdquo; (Canon of the Bible, p.
127).</p>
<p>From a work entitled &ldquo;The New Bible and Its Uses&rdquo; Prof.
Andrew D. White, our present minister to Germany, in his &ldquo;Warfare
of Science&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb136" href="#pb136"
name="pb136">136</a>]</span>(vol. ii, p. 306), quotes the following in
relation to John, which shows how rapidly the supposed authenticity of
Bible books is disappearing before the investigations of the Higher
Critics:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the period of thirty years ending in 1860, of the fifty
great authorities in this line, four to one were in favor of the
Johannine authorship&#8202;&hellip;. Of those who have contributed
important articles to the discussion from 1880 to 1890, about two to
one reject the Johannine authorship of the Gospel in its present
shape&mdash;that is to say, while forty years ago great scholars were
<i>four to one in favor of</i>, they are now <i>two to one against</i>,
the claim that the Apostle John wrote the Gospel as we have
it.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">The Four Gospels.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The principal reason for rejecting both the reputed
authorship and the credibility of the Four Gospels is the contradictory
character of their contents. If Jesus Christ was a historical
personage, as Christians believe, these alleged biographies were not
written by his Apostles and their companions; neither were they
compiled from authentic records.</p>
<p>The Greek text of the Gospels disproves their authenticity. Their
assigned authors, or two of them at least, were unlearned Jews. Their
work was confined chiefly to the lower classes of their countrymen, in
a land where Greek was almost unknown. The absurdity of this is shown
by Mrs. Besant: &ldquo;The only parallel for so curious <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb137" href="#pb137" name="pb137">137</a>]</span>a
phenomenon as these Greek Gospels, written by ignorant Jews, would be
if a Cornish fisherman and a low London attorney, both perfectly
ignorant of German, wrote in German the sayings and doings of a
Middlesex carpenter, and as their work was entirely confined to the
lower classes of the people, who knew nothing of German, and they
desired to place within their reach full knowledge of the
carpenter&rsquo;s life, they circulated it among them in German only,
and never wrote anything about him in English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctrines of the immaculate conception and of a material
resurrection, so prominent in the Four Gospels, are proofs of their
late origin. These doctrines are not taught in the older books of the
New Testament, and were unknown to the Christians of the first
century.</p>
<p>The scholarly author of &ldquo;Supernatural Religion,&rdquo; after a
patient and exhaustive examination of every accessible document
relating to the subject, writes as follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After having exhausted the literature and the testimony
bearing on the point, we have not found a single distinct trace of any
of those Gospels during the first century and a half after the death of
Jesus&rdquo; (Vol. II., p. 248).</p>
<p>Bishop Faustus, a heretical theologian of the fifth century,
referring to this so so-called Gospel history, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is allowed not to have been written by the Son himself nor
by his Apostles, but long after by some unknown men who, lest they
should be <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb138" href="#pb138" name=
"pb138">138</a>]</span>suspected of writing things they knew nothing
of, gave to their books the names of the Apostles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Regarding these four books and their sequel, Acts, Rev. Dr.
Hooykaas, the noted theologian and critic of Holland, voices the
opinion of himself and his renowned associates, Dr. Kuenen and Dr.
Oort, in the following words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our interest is more especially excited by the five
historical books of the New Testament. If we might really suppose them
to have been written by the men whose names they bear, we could never
be thankful enough for such precious authorities&#8202;&hellip;. But,
alas! not one of these five books was really written by the person
whose name it bears&mdash;though for the sake of brevity we shall still
call the writers Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John&mdash;and they are all
of more recent date than their headings would lead us to
suppose&#8202;&hellip;. We cannot say that the Gospels and the book of
Acts are <i>unauthentic</i>, for not one of them professes to give the
name of its author. They appeared anonymously. The titles placed above
them in our Bibles owe their origin to a later ecclesiastical tradition
which deserves no confidence whatever&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol.
III., p. 24).</p>
<p>The Pentateuch was not written by Moses, nor the Four Gospels by
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. The authenticity of the chief books of
the New Testament, like that of the chief books of the Old, must be
given up. The results <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb139" href=
"#pb139" name="pb139">139</a>]</span>of our review of them may be
summed up in the words of the great German, Ferdinand Christian Baur:
&ldquo;These Gospels are spurious, and were written in the second
century.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb140" href="#pb140"

historical book of Acts, the Catholic Epistles, and Revelation. In some

<h3 class="main">Acts of the Apostles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Acts of the Apostles is one of many books bearing
this name which appeared during the early centuries of the church.
Concerning the origin of our canonical Acts, Dr. Hitchcock says:
&ldquo;It was written by Luke, in considerable part from his own
observations of the facts narrated, and about <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> 63, and at Rome, during Paul&rsquo;s stay
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Gospel of Luke is addressed to Theophilus; the book of Acts is
addressed to the same person, and as the author states that he has
addressed a former work to him, it is inferred that both works were
written by the same person. It has been shown that Theophilus lived in
the latter part of the second century, and that the Gospel <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb141" href="#pb141" name="pb141">141</a>]</span>of
Luke was written at this time. If Luke and Acts, then, were written by
the same person, and Acts was written after Luke, it also must have
been written late in the second century, and consequently could not
have been written by Luke, the companion of Paul.</p>
<p>It is asserted that Luke was the associate of Paul, and that he was
in Rome with Paul when his book was written. This implies Paul&rsquo;s
sanction of the book. But if the Epistles of Paul are genuine, and it
is generally agreed that those bearing upon this question are, this can
not be true; for the Paul of these epistles and the Paul of Acts are
two entirely different characters.</p>
<p>The book is entitled the Acts of the Apostles; and yet the acts of
Peter and Paul are almost the only apostolic acts recorded. Besides the
narrative of the author, the book consists largely of discourses
attributed to Peter and Paul. But the style of the &ldquo;unlearned and
ignorant&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204:13&amp;version=NRSV">iv,
13</a>) Peter is so similar to that of Paul with his &ldquo;much
learning&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%2026:24&amp;version=NRSV">xxvi,
24</a>), and both so closely resemble the style of the author, that one
not strongly imbued with faith must conclude that the whole is the
product of one mind.</p>
<p>The author cites a speech made by Gamaliel before the Jewish
council, in which he uses the following language: &ldquo;For before
these days rose up Theudas, boasting himself to be somebody; to whom a
number of men, almost four <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb142" href=
"#pb142" name="pb142">142</a>]</span>hundred, joined themselves, who
were slain,&rdquo; etc. (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%205:36&amp;version=NRSV">v,
36</a>).</p>
<p>Josephus, who gives an account of this event (Antiq. Bk. xx, ch. v,
sec. 1), says that it happened &ldquo;while Fadus was Procurator of
Judea.&rdquo; This was 45 or 46 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>
Gamaliel&rsquo;s speech was delivered, according to the accepted
chronology, 29 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> Thus the author of Acts
makes Gamaliel refer to an event as long past which in reality did not
happen until sixteen years after that time.</p>
<p>Continuing his speech, Gamaliel refers to another event, as follows:
&ldquo;After this man [Theudas] rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of
the taxing, and drew away much people after him; he also
perished&rdquo; (37).</p>
<p>Here the author makes Gamaliel state that the sedition of Judas of
Galilee occurred after that of Theudas, when in fact it occurred in 6
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>&mdash;forty years before. Such grave
discrepancies could have been made only by one writing long after the
date claimed.</p>
<p>Holtzmann, a German critic, has shown that the author of Acts
borrowed from the Antiquities of Josephus. The Antiquities appeared 93
<span class="sc">A.D.</span>&mdash;just thirty years after the date
assigned to Acts.</p>
<p>This book will not be given up by orthodox Christians without a
struggle. The authenticity of primitive Christianity depends largely
upon the authenticity of this book. Renan who was a Rationalist, and,
at the same time <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb143" href="#pb143"
name="pb143">143</a>]</span>something of an apologist for Christianity,
affirms that the last pages of Acts, which are devoted almost entirely
to Paul&rsquo;s missionary labors constitute the only historical record
of the early church. At the same time, he admits that it is the most
faulty book in the New Testament. The Rev. Dr. Hooykaas concedes the
same. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of the earliest fortunes of the community of Jesus, the
primitive history of the Christian church and the whole of the
apostolic age, we should know as good as nothing if we had not the book
of Acts. If only we could trust the writer fully! But we soon see that
the utmost caution is necessary. For we have another account of some of
the things about which this writer tells us&mdash;an account written by
the very man to whom they refer, the best possible authority,
therefore, as to what really took place. This man is Paul himself. In
the first two chapters of the epistle to the Galatians he gives us
several details of his own past life; and no sooner do we place his
story side by side with that of the Acts than we clearly perceive that
this book contains an incorrect account, and that its inaccuracy is not
the result of accident or ignorance, but of a deliberate design, an
attempt&mdash;conceived no doubt with the best intentions&mdash;to hide
in some degree the actual course of events&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
Vol. III., p. 25).</p>
<p>The dissensions which arose in the first century <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb144" href="#pb144" name=
"pb144">144</a>]</span>between the Jewish Christians and the Gentile
Christians had only increased with time, and these were among the chief
obstacles in the way of uniting Christians and establishing the
Catholic church. The composition of Acts was one of the many attempts
made toward the close of the second century to heal these dissensions.
The author was a man who cared little for either Petrine or Pauline
Christianity&mdash;little for the so-called truths of Christianity in
any form&mdash;but a man who cared much for church unity and church
power.</p>
<p>The book of Acts was little known at first. St. Chrysostom, writing
in the fifth century, says: &ldquo;This book is not so much as known to
many. They know neither the book nor by whom it was written.&rdquo;</p>

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The seven Catholic Epistles, James, First and Second
Peter, First, Second, and Third John, and Jude, have been declared
spurious or doubtful by eminent Christian scholars in every age of the
church. The Fathers were loath to admit them into the Bible, and their
right to a place there has always been disputed.</p>
<p>James and Jude, the first and the last of these epistles, orthodox
Christians believe, were written by James and Jude, the brothers of
Jesus, in 62 and 64 <span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p>Three leading orthodox authorities, representing the three great
divisions of the Christian <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb145" href=
"#pb145" name="pb145">145</a>]</span>church, Cajetan of the Roman
Catholic church; Lucar of the Greek Catholic church, and Erasmus of the
Protestant church, have denied the authenticity of James. Luther
himself refused to accept it. He says: &ldquo;The Epistle of <a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jas%201&amp;version=NRSV">
James I</a> account the writing of no apostle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The composition of Jude and Second Peter are both placed in
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> 64. There is no proof that either was in
existence in <span class="sc">A.D.</span> 164. It is only necessary to
read Jude and the second chapter of Second Peter to see that one
borrowed from the other. While most believe that the author of Second
Peter used Jude in the construction of his epistle, Luther contends
that Jude is the plagiarist. He says: &ldquo;The epistle of Jude is an
abstract or copy of St. Peter&rsquo;s Second&rdquo; (Preface to
Luther&rsquo;s Version).</p>
<p>Jude cites as authentic the apocryphal book of Enoch, and the
apocryphal story of Michael the archangel contending with Satan for the
body of Moses. Origen, Jerome, and others in ancient, and Calvin,
Grotius and others in modern times, have doubted its authenticity.
Mayerhoff says it was written in the second century to combat the
heresies of the Carpocratians.</p>

<h3 class="main">Epistles of Peter.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Most Christians contend that the First Epistle of
Peter is genuine. Some of the early Christian Fathers, however,
rejected it. Iren&aelig;us did not place it in his canon. Not until the
third century was it accepted as the writing of Peter.</p>
<p>The celebrated Tubingen school of critics rejects <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb146" href="#pb146" name="pb146">146</a>]</span>the
authenticity of the book. Baur and Zeller believe it to be a Pauline
document. Schwegler believes that it was written to reconcile the
Pauline and Petrine doctrines. The Dutch critics say that it was
borrowed largely from Paul and James, and that it was probably written
early in the second century. Regarding its authorship, Jules Soury, of
the University of France, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody, however, knows better than he [Renan] that the
so-called First Epistle of Peter, full of allusions to Paul&rsquo;s
writings, as well as the epistle to the Hebrews and the epistle of
James, dates in all probability from the year 130 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span>, at the earliest, thus placing two generations between
the time of its composition and the latter years of the reign of Nero,
when Peter is fabled to have been in Rome&rdquo; (Jesus and the
Gospels, p. 32).</p>
<p>All critics pronounce Second Peter a forgery. Chambers&rsquo;s
Encyclopedia says: &ldquo;So far as external authority is concerned, it
has hardly any. The most critical and competent of the Fathers were
suspicious of its authenticity; it was rarely if ever quoted, and was
not formally admitted into the canon till the Council of Hippo, 393
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> The internal evidence is just as
unsatisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo; contains the following
relative to its authenticity: &ldquo;We have few references to it in
the writings of the early Fathers; the style differs materially from
that of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb147" href="#pb147" name=
"pb147">147</a>]</span>the First Epistle, and the resemblance amounting
to a studied imitation between this epistle and that of Jude, seems
scarcely reconcilable with the position of Peter&#8202;&hellip;. Many
reject the epistle altogether as spurious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is believed by some that the original title of Second Peter was
the Epistle of Simeon. Grotius argues that it is a compilation from two
older epistles. The third chapter begins as follows: &ldquo;This second
epistle, beloved, I now write unto you.&rdquo; These words clearly
denote the beginning of a document. Those who affirm its genuineness
consider the second chapter an interpolation. Westcott says there is no
evidence of the existence of this epistle prior to 170 <span class=
"sc">A.D.</span> Scaliger declares it to be a &ldquo;fiction of some
ancient Christian misemploying his leisure time.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="main">Epistles of John.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The so-called Epistles of John, so far as the books
themselves are concerned, are anonymous. They do not purport to have
been written by the Apostle John, nor by anyone bearing the name of
John.</p>
<p>Of First John, &ldquo;Chambers&rsquo;s Encyclopedia&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;Of the epistles it is almost certain that the First proceeded
from the same writer who composed the [Fourth] Gospel. In style,
language, and doctrine, it is identical with it.&rdquo; If John did not
write the Fourth Gospel, and it is conceded by most writers that he did
not, then he did not write this epistle. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb148" href="#pb148" name="pb148">148</a>]</span></p>
<p>Referring to the Gospel of John, whose authenticity he denies and
whose composition he assigns to the second century, Dr. Hooykaas says:
&ldquo;The First Epistle of John soon issued from the same school in
imitation of the Gospel&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol. III, p.
692).</p>
<p>Of two passages in the First Epistle, <a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Jn%202:23&amp;version=NRSV">

v, 7</a>, which teach the doctrine of the Trinity, the &ldquo;Bible
Dictionary&rdquo; says: &ldquo;It would appear without doubt that they
are not genuine.&rdquo; The Revisers of the King James version
pronounced them spurious.</p>
<p>The second and third epistles were not written by the writer of the
first. The early Fathers rejected them. Eusebius in the fourth century
classed them with the doubtful books. It has been claimed that the
second epistle was written for the purpose of counteracting the
heretical teachings of Basilides and his followers. Basilides was a
famous writer of the second century.</p>
<p>These epistles have the following superscriptions: &ldquo;The elder
[presbyter] unto the elect lady&rdquo; to the first, and &ldquo;The
elder unto the well-beloved Gaius&rdquo; to the second. The declaration
that they are from an elder or presbyter proves that they are not from
an apostle, and consequently not from the Apostle John. If they were
written by a writer named John, it was probably John the Presbyter, who
lived in the second century. Jerome states that they were generally
credited to him. In his account of John the Presbyter, Judge Waite
says: &ldquo;He <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb149" href="#pb149"
name="pb149">149</a>]</span>is also, not without reason, believed to
have been the author of the Epistles of John<span class="corr" id=

<h3 class="main">Revelation.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Revelation is the last book of the Bible, and the one
least understood. Christians themselves are not agreed as to its
meaning. Some believe it to be a series of prophecies which have had
their fulfilment in the struggles between Christianity and Paganism;
others believe that its prophecies are yet to be fulfilled; still
others pronounce it a symbolical poem, representing the conflict
between truth and error, while not a few consider it the recorded
fancies of a diseased imagination.</p>
<p>The book purports to be from &ldquo;John to the seven churches of
Asia&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%201:4&amp;version=NRSV">i,
4</a>). This John is declared to be the Apostle John and its authority
is based upon this claim. Smith&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bible Dictionary&rdquo;
says: &ldquo;The question as to the canonical authority of the
Revelation resolves itself into a question of authorship. Was St. John
the Apostle and Evangelist the writer of the Revelation?&rdquo; If John
the Apostle and the author of the Fourth Gospel were one, as assumed by
the &ldquo;Bible Dictionary,&rdquo; then the question of its
authenticity and canonical authority must be abandoned, for the author
of the Fourth Gospel did not write it. There is nothing in common
between them. The German theologian, Lucke, says: &ldquo;If all
critical experience and rules in such literary questions do
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb150" href="#pb150" name=
"pb150">150</a>]</span>not deceive, it is certain that the Evangelist
and Apocalyptist are two different persons.&rdquo; De Wette says:
&ldquo;The Apostle John, if he be the author of the Fourth Gospel and
of the Johannine epistles, did not write the Apocalypse.&rdquo;
Regarding this conclusion, Ewald says: &ldquo;All men capable of
forming a judgment are of the same opinion.&rdquo; Among the eminent
critics and commentators who take this position are Luther<span class=
"corr" id="xd26e3950" title="Not in source">,</span> Erasmus,
Michaelis, Schleiermacher, Credner, Zeller, Evanson, Baur, Renan, and
Davidson.</p>
<p>The Apostle John wrote neither the Fourth Gospel, the so-called
Epistles of John, nor Revelation. That he did not write Revelation is
shown by the following:</p>
<p>1. The author does not claim to be an apostle.</p>
<p>2. He refers to the Twelve Apostles (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rev%2021:14&amp;version=NRSV">xxi,
14</a>) in a way that forbids the supposition that he was one of
them.</p>
<p>3. The Apostle John is declared to have been illiterate and
incapable of writing a book.</p>
<p>4. It is addressed to the seven churches of Asia, and yet the seven
churches of Asia, to which it is addressed, rejected it.</p>
<p>The Alogi maintained that it was a forgery which came from Corinth.
Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria, writing in the third century, says:
&ldquo;Divers of our predecessors have wholly refused and rejected this
book, and by discussing the several parts thereof have found it obscure
and void of reason and the title forged.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb151" href="#pb151" name="pb151">151</a>]</span></p>
<p>Concerning its rejection by modern churchmen, the Edinburgh Review
(No. 131) says: &ldquo;The most learned and intelligent of Protestant
divines here almost all doubted or denied the canonicity of the book of
Revelation. Calvin and Beza pronounced the book unintelligible, and
prohibited the pastors of Geneva from all attempts at
interpretation.&rdquo; Dr. South described it as &ldquo;a book that
either found a man mad or left him so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Luther, in the Preface to his New Testament (Ed. of 1522) writes:
&ldquo;In the Revelation of John much is wanting to let me deem it
either prophetic or apostolical.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, First and
Second Thessalonians, First and Second Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and

<h3 class="main">Genuine Epistles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The genuine Epistles of Paul, those whose authenticity
is conceded by nearly all critics, are Romans, First and Second
Corinthians, and Galatians. The term &ldquo;genuine&rdquo; is applied
to the books as originally written, and not to the text as it now
exists. It is probable that they have undergone various changes since
they left Paul&rsquo;s hand. The last two chapters of Romans are
believed to be interpolations. The fifteenth consists chiefly of
irrelevant matter which detracts from the symmetry of the work. The
sixteenth is mostly filled with salutations. In these several women are
given a prominence in church affairs that is wholly at variance with
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb153" href="#pb153" name=
"pb153">153</a>]</span>Paul&rsquo;s attitude toward woman. The
subscription to the First Epistle to the Corinthians states that it
&ldquo;was written from Philippi.&rdquo; The 19th verse of the last
chapter shows that Paul was in Asia instead of Europe, while the 8th
verse expressly declares that he was at Ephesus<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e3991" title="Not in source">.</span> The Second Epistle to
Corinthians, it is declared, &ldquo;was written from Philippi&rdquo;
also. That this is doubtful is admitted even by the most orthodox
authorities. The subscription to Galatians reads as follows:
&ldquo;Unto the Galatians, written from Rome.&rdquo; This book was
written between 52 and 55 <span class="sc">A.D.</span>; Paul did not go
to Rome until 61 <span class="sc">A.D.</span> This epistle was written
from Ephesus.</p>
<p>While critics are nearly unanimous in acknowledging the genuineness
of these books, a few, including Professor Thudichum of Germany, Prof.
Edwin Johnson of England, and W. H. Burr of this country, pronounce
them forgeries, and contend that the Paul of the New Testament is a
myth.</p>

<h3 class="main">Doubtful Epistles.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The doubtful Epistles, those whose authenticity is
accepted by some critics and rejected by others, are Philippians, First
Thessalonians, and Philemon. Sixty years ago to this list of doubtful
books critics would have added three others&mdash;Ephesians,
Colossians, and Second Thessalonians; but the critical labors of the
Tubingen school and others have relegated these to the already burdened
shelf of spurious Bible books.</p>
<p>In regard to Philippians, Ferdinand Baur, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb154" href="#pb154" name="pb154">154</a>]</span>for
thirty years head of the Tubingen school and unquestionably the
greatest of Bible critics, says: &ldquo;The Epistles to the Colossians
and to the Philippians &hellip; are spurious, and were written by the
Catholic school near the end of the second century, to heal the strife
between the Jew and Gentile factions&rdquo; (Paul the Apostle of Jesus
Christ).</p>
<p>Baur also rejects First Thessalonians. He contends that this, as
well as the Second Epistle, contains teachings quite at variance with
the teachings of Paul. The German critic Schrader is confident that
Paul did not write First Thessalonians.</p>
<p>Respecting Philemon, Dr. Hitchcock says: &ldquo;This brief Epistle
was written at the same time with those to the Colossians and
Ephesians, and was sent along with them by Tychicus and
Onesimus.&rdquo; As Colossians and Ephesians have both been declared
spurious by the ablest Christian scholars, Philemon, to say the least,
is placed in bad company. This Epistle was written in behalf of one
Onesimus, a zealous Christian, who is also mentioned in Colossians.
There was an Onesimus, a zealous church worker, living in 175
<span class="sc">A.D.</span></p>
<p>Holland&rsquo;s critics, Dr. Kuenen, Dr. Oort, and Dr. Hooykaas, are
disposed to accept Philippians, First Thessalonians, and Philemon, but
admit that there are grave doubts concerning the authenticity of each.

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The spurious Epistles, those whose authenticity is
generally denied by the critics, are Ephesians, Colossians, Second
Thessalonians, First and Second Timothy, Titus, and Hebrews.</p>
<p>Ewald and De Wette both admit that Ephesians was not written by St.
Paul. De Wette thinks it was compiled from Colossians. Davidson and
Mayerhoff believe that neither Ephesians nor Colossians is genuine. I
have quoted Baur&rsquo;s rejection of Colossians. The Encyclopedia
Britannica says: &ldquo;It is undeniable that the Epistle to the
Colossians and the so-called Epistle to the Ephesians differ
considerably in language and thought from other Pauline Epistles and
that their relation to one another demands explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First and Second Thessalonians are pronounced the oldest of
Paul&rsquo;s writings, both belonging, it is claimed, to 52
<span class="sc">A.D.</span> The author of the Second Epistle is very
desirous of having his writing accepted as a genuine Epistle of Paul.
Several times he declares himself to be Paul. He warns them not to be
deceived &ldquo;by letter as from us&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%202:2&amp;version=NRSV">ii,
2</a>), and concludes with &ldquo;the salutation of Paul with mine own
hand, which is the token in every Epistle.&rdquo; This Epistle affirms
the first to be a forgery. The first was probably written at an early
date, and, whether genuine or spurious, was accepted as a Pauline
Epistle. In it the early advent of Christ&mdash;during Paul&rsquo;s
lifetime&mdash;is predicted. &ldquo;We, <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb156" href="#pb156" name="pb156">156</a>]</span>which are alive and
remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are
asleep&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%204:5&amp;version=NRSV">iv,
15</a>). &ldquo;Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up
together with them in the clouds&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Thes%204:17&amp;version=NRSV">17</a>).
Generations passed, Christ did not come, and the church was losing
faith in Paul and Christianity. To restore confidence, another letter
from Paul to the Thessalonians was &ldquo;found,&rdquo; and this
repudiates the first. He exhorts them not to be troubled,
&ldquo;neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as
that the day of Christ is at hand&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Thes%202:2&amp;version=NRSV">ii,
2</a>). It teaches the second coming of Christ, but carefully leaves
the time indefinite. Whatever may be said of the First Epistle, the
Second is clearly a forgery.</p>
<p>With respect to these Epistles, the Britannica says: &ldquo;The
predominant opinion of modern criticism at present is that the
genuineness of the First Epistle is certain, while that of the Second
must be given up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First and Second Timothy and Titus, known as the Pastoral Epistles,
and Hebrews were not written by Paul. The Pastoral Epistles are
forgeries, while Hebrews is an anonymous work. The contents of these
books betray a later date. Their teachings are not the teachings of
Paul. Their language is utterly unlike that of the genuine Epistles.
They contain two hundred words never used by Paul. Marcion, the most
noted Pauline Christian of the second century, who made a collection of
Paul&rsquo;s Epistles, excluded <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb157"
href="#pb157" name="pb157">157</a>]</span>them. Tatian and Basilides
also rejected them.</p>
<p>Against the authenticity of the Pastoral Epistles may be cited
nearly every modern critic, including the four great names of Baur,
Eichorn, De Wette, and Davidson. Baur says they were written in the
second century.</p>
<p>While thirteen of the so-called Pauline Epistles claim to have been
written by Paul, Hebrews alone is silent regarding its authorship.
Tertullian classed it with the apocryphal books, but thought it might
have been written by Barnabas. In the Clermont codex it is called the
Epistle of Barnabas. According to Origen, some ascribe it to Luke,
others to Clement of Rome. Origen himself says: &ldquo;Who it was that
really wrote the Epistle, God only knows.&rdquo; Dr. Westcott admits
that there is no evidence that Paul wrote it. Grotius attributes it to
Luke, Luther to Apollos. Luther says: &ldquo;That the Epistle to the
Hebrews is not by St. Paul, nor, indeed, by any apostle, is shown by
chapter ii, 3&rdquo; (Preface to Luther&rsquo;s N. T.).</p>
<p>Concerning the seven books that we have been considering, Dr.
Hooykaas says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fourteen Epistles are said to be Paul&rsquo;s; but we must at
once strike off one, namely, that to the Hebrews, which does not bear
his name at all&#8202;&hellip;. The two letters to Timothy and the
letter to Titus were certainly composed long after the death of
Paul&#8202;&hellip;. It is more than probable that the letters to the
Ephesians and <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb158" href="#pb158" name=
"pb158">158</a>]</span>Colossians are also unauthentic, and the same
suspicion rests, perhaps, on the first, but certainly on the second of
the Epistles to the Thessalonians&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol.
III., p. 23).</p>
<p>The Rev. John W. Chadwick, in his &ldquo;Bible of To-day,&rdquo;
says that the first four Epistles &ldquo;are his [Paul&rsquo;s] with
absolute certainty.&rdquo; Four others, Philippians, Colossians, First
Thessalonians, and Philemon, he is disposed to accept, but admits that
their authenticity is doubtful. The remaining books he pronounces
spurious.</p>
<p>Persons in this age have little conception of the <span class="corr"
id="xd26e4069" title="Source: prevalency">prevalence</span> of literary
forgeries in the early centuries of the church. Now, when books are
printed in editions of 1,000 or more, such forgeries are nearly
impossible and consequently rare. When books existed in manuscript
only, they were neither difficult nor uncommon. Books and letters
purporting to have been written by Paul, Peter, John, and other
Apostles were readily &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; when wanted. Of these
Apostolic forgeries Prof. John Tyndall says: &ldquo;When arguments or
proofs were needed, whether on the side of the Jewish Christians or of
the Gentile Christians, a document was discovered which met the case,
and on which the name of an Apostle or of some authoritative
contemporary of the Apostles was boldly inscribed. The end being held
to justify the means, there was no lack of manufactured
testimony.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb159" href="#pb159"

<h3 class="main">Conclusion.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Of these fourteen Epistles ascribed to Paul, four,
then, Romans, First and Second Corinthians, and Galatians, are
pronounced genuine; three, Philippians, First Thessalonians, and
Philemon, are of doubtful authenticity; while seven, Ephesians,
Colossians, Second Thessalonians, First and Second Timothy, Titus, and
Hebrews, are spurious.</p>
<p>The genuine writings of Paul are probably the oldest Christian
writings extant. Admitting the authenticity of these four books, of
course, is not admitting the authenticity of Christianity. Paul was not
a witness of the alleged events upon which historical Christianity
rests. He was not a convert to Christianity until many years after
Christ&rsquo;s death. He did not see Christ (save in a vision); he did
not listen to his teachings; he did not learn from his disciples.
&ldquo;The gospel which was preached of me is not after man, for I
neither received it of man, neither was I taught it&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gal%201:11-12&amp;version=NRSV">Gal.
i, 11, 12</a>). Paul accepted only to a small extent the religion of
Christ&rsquo;s disciples. He professed to derive his knowledge from
supernatural sources&mdash;from trances and visions. Regarding the
value of such testimony, the author of &ldquo;Supernatural
Religion&rdquo; says: &ldquo;No one can deny, and medical and
psychological annals prove, that many men have been subject to visions
and hallucinations which have never been seriously attributed to
supernatural causes. There is not one single <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb160" href="#pb160" name=
"pb160">160</a>]</span>valid reason removing the ecstatic visions and
trances of the Apostle Paul from this class.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>We have now reviewed the books of the Bible and presented some of
the historical and internal evidences bearing upon the question of
their authenticity. The authenticity of the books of the New Testament,
we have seen, is but little better attested than that of the Old. The
authors of twenty books&mdash;Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Acts,
Ephesians, Colossians, Second Thessalonians, First and Second Timothy,
Titus, Hebrews, James, First and Second Peter, First, Second, and Third
John, Jude, and Revelation&mdash;are unknown. Three
books&mdash;Philippians, First Thessalonians, and Philemon&mdash;are of
questionable authenticity. Four books only&mdash;Romans, First and
Second Corinthians, and Galatians&mdash;are generally admitted to be
authentic.</p>
<p>Of the sixty-six books of the Bible at least fifty are anonymous
works or forgeries. To teach that these books are divine, and to accept
them as such, denotes a degree of depravity on the one hand, and an
amount of credulity on the other, that are not creditable to a moral
and enlightened people. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb161" href=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">&ldquo;The Bible does not contain the shadow of a
shade of error from Genesis to Revelation&rdquo;&mdash;Cheever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every book of it, every chapter of it, every verse of it,
every word of it, is the direct utterance of the Most
High.&rdquo;&mdash;Bunyan.</p>
<p>Such are the dogmatic assertions of Bibliolaters. So much confidence
do they pretend to repose in the doctrine of the Bible&rsquo;s
inerrancy that they propose the most crucial tests for its
submission.</p>
<p>The Rev. Jeremiah Jones, one of the highest orthodox authorities on
the canon, lays down this rule in determining the right of a book to a
place in the canon:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That book is apocryphal which contains contradictions; or
which contains histories, or proposes doctrines contrary to those which
are known to be true; or which contains ludicrous <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb164" href="#pb164" name=
"pb164">164</a>]</span>trifling, fabulous, or silly relations; or which
contains anachronisms; or wherein the style is clearly different from
the known style of the author whose name it bears&rdquo; (New Methods,
Vol. I., p. 70).</p>
<p>The Rev. T. Hartwell Horne, a standard authority in the orthodox
church, submits this test in determining the divinity of the Bible as a
whole:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If real contradictions exist in the Bible, it is sufficient
proof that it is not divinely inspired, whatever pretenses it may make
to such inspiration&rdquo; (Introduction to the Scriptures, Vol. I., p.
581).</p>
<p>I challenge the verity of Cheever&rsquo;s and Bunyan&rsquo;s claims
and proceed to apply to this book the tests of Jones and Horne. Instead
of not containing the shadow of a shade of error, I shall show that it
is so filled with the darkness of error that the truths existing in it
are scarcely discernible. Instead of being the direct utterance of the
Most High, I shall show that every book of it, every chapter of it,
every verse of it, every word of it, is the direct utterance of man. I
shall impeach the authority of the Christian canon and show that all of
its books are apocryphal; that they contain histories and propose
doctrines that are contrary to what is known to be true; that they
contain ludicrous, trifling, fabulous, and silly relations; that they
abound with anachronisms. If I have not already shown that the style of
these books is clearly <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb165" href=
"#pb165" name="pb165">165</a>]</span>different from the known style of
the authors whose names they bear, it is because the &ldquo;known
style&rdquo; of these authors is a myth. I shall adduce enough
<i>real</i> contradictions from the Bible to not only refute the claim
that it is divinely inspired, but to destroy its credibility even as a
human authority.</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Errors of Transcribers.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">If the Bible were a divine revelation, as claimed, it
would have been divinely preserved. Not only the original writers, but
the transcribers, translators, and printers, also, would have been
divinely inspired. It is admitted that divine inspiration was confined
to the original writers. Consequently the Bible, as we have it, cannot
be an infallible revelation. If it be not an infallible revelation it
cannot be a divine revelation.</p>
<p>It is popularly supposed that the books of the Bible, as originally
written, have been preserved free from corruptions. That they are full
of textual errors&mdash;that the books as they were originally written
no longer exist and cannot be restored&mdash;is conceded even by the
most orthodox of the Lower Critics. The principal causes of these
corruptions are the following:</p>
<p>1. Clerical errors. The invention of printing made it possible to
preserve the original text of a writer comparatively free from errors.
With the works of ancient writers this was impossible. For a period of
from 1,200 to 2,200 years preceding <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb166" href="#pb166" name="pb166">166</a>]</span>the invention of
printing the only means of preserving the books of the Bible was the
pen of the scribe. However careful the copyist might be, errors would
creep into the text. But instead of being careful these copyists, many
of them, were notoriously careless. This is especially evident in the
case of numbers. Hundreds of errors were made in the transcription of
these alone. Probably one-half of the numbers given in the Old
Testament, and many in the New, are not those given in the original
text, but are errors due to the carelessness of transcribers and a want
of divine supervision.</p>
<p>2. Interpolations. There are thousands of interpolations in the
Bible. A considerable portion of the words printed in Italics in our
version are acknowledged interpolations. Many of them appeared first in
the shape of marginal notes intended to explain or correct a statement
in the text. Later scribes incorporated these into the text. And thus,
while God was engaged in watching sparrows and numbering the hairs in
his children&rsquo;s heads, additions in this and various other ways
were made to his word. In many instances whole chapters were added to
the original documents.</p>
<p>3. Omissions. Much matter was carelessly omitted. To quote the Bible
for Learners, &ldquo;not only letters and words, but whole verses have
fallen out.&rdquo; Objectionable matter was intentionally omitted.
Chrysostom tells us that entire books were destroyed by the Jews. They
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb167" href="#pb167" name=
"pb167">167</a>]</span>were on such familiar terms with the Deity that
they could obtain other and more desirable ones for the asking.</p>
<p>4. Textual changes. In innumerable places the text has been wilfully
changed to suit the religious and other notions of the priests. Let me
cite an example. In early copies, and probably in the original text,
<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2018:22&amp;version=NRSV">
Genesis xviii, 22</a>, reads as follows: &ldquo;The Lord yet stood
before Abraham.&rdquo; They thought it detracted from God&rsquo;s
dignity to stand before one of his creatures, and so they changed it to
its present form, &ldquo;Abraham stood yet before the Lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning the corruptions of the scribes, Dr. Davidson says:
&ldquo;They did not refrain from changing what had been written, or
inserting fresh matter&rdquo; (Canon, p. 34).</p>
<p>The facts that I have mentioned apply not merely to the Old
Testament, but to the New Testament as well. Westcott, a very high
authority on the canon, says: &ldquo;It does not appear that any
special care was taken in the first age to preserve the books of the
New Testament from the various injuries of time or to insure perfect
accuracy of transcription&#8202;&hellip;. The original copies seem to
have soon perished.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Errors of Translators.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">These errors of the transcribers have been
immeasurably increased by the translators. A perfect translation is
impossible, and for these reasons: 1. No language has words to express
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb168" href="#pb168" name=
"pb168">168</a>]</span>perfectly all the words of another language. 2.
Languages change with time and the words of one age have a different
meaning in the next. 3. Many writers do not express themselves clearly,
and it is often impossible to fully comprehend their meaning. This is
especially true of Bible writers. 4. No two translators will grasp the
meaning of a writer in exactly the same manner, or convey it in the
same words.</p>
<p>In regard to the Old Testament the Hebrew language, as anciently
written, was the most difficult of all languages to translate. It was
written from right to left; the words contained no vowels; there were
no intervening spaces between the words, and no punctuation marks. Even
with the introduction of vowel points many words in Hebrew, as in
English, have more than one meaning. Without these points, as
originally written, the number is increased a hundred fold. The five
English words, <i>bag</i>, <i>beg</i>, <i>big</i>, <i>bog</i>, and
<i>bug</i>, are quite unlike and easily distinguished. Omit the vowels,
as the ancient Jews did, and we have five words exactly alike, or
rather, one word with five different meanings. The Hebrew language was
thus largely composed of words with several meanings. As there were no
spaces between words it was sometimes hard to tell where a word began
or where it ended; and as there were no punctuation marks, and no
spaces between sentences, paragraphs, or even sections, it was often
difficult <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb169" href="#pb169" name=
"pb169">169</a>]</span>to determine the meaning of a writer after the
words had been deciphered.</p>
<p>Here is the best known passage in the Bible printed in English as
the Jews would have written it in Hebrew:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first xd26e4183">bllwhtmcmdgnkhtmnhtbdllhnvhntrhchwrhtfR<br>
vgrfwsstbdrsvgrfdndrbldrdshtsvgnvhnstshtrnnd<br>
nkhtsnhtrflvmrfsrvldtbnttpmttntnsdldnsrtbdrn<br>
nmrvrfrlghtdnrphtdnmdg</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the printed text there is little danger of mistaking one letter
for another; in the written text there is, especially if they resemble
each other. The Hebrew letters corresponding to our D and R were nearly
alike and easily confounded. Consequently in <a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%201:14&amp;version=NRSV">
Numbers i, 14</a>, we have &ldquo;Eliasaph the son of Deuel,&rdquo; and
in <a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Nm%202:14&amp;version=NRSV">
Numbers ii, 14</a>, &ldquo;Eliasaph the son of Reuel.&rdquo; Only God
knows which is correct, and he does not care to enlighten us. Therefore
we must believe that both are correct or be damned.</p>
<p>St. Jerome says: &ldquo;When we translate the Hebrew into Latin we
are sometimes guided by conjecture.&rdquo; Le Clerc says: &ldquo;The
learned merely guess at the sense of the Old Testament in an infinity
of places&rdquo; (Sentim, p. 156). The Old Testament as we have it,
then, consists largely of guesses and conjectures.</p>
<p>The title page of our Authorized Version of the Bible contains these
words: &ldquo;Translated out of the original tongues.&rdquo; The Old
Testament is declared to be a correct translation of the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb170" href="#pb170" name=
"pb170">170</a>]</span>accepted Hebrew. In its preparation, however,
the Greek more than the Hebrew version was followed. Referring to the
King James translators, the historian John Clark Ridpath says:
&ldquo;Following the Septuagint rather than the Hebrew original, they
fell into many errors which a riper scholarship would have
avoided&rdquo; (Cyclopedia of Universal History. Vol. II., p. 763).
Instead of being a collection of original guesses and conjectures our
Old Testament is, to a great extent, merely a bad English translation
of a corrupted copy of a spurious Greek translation of the original (?)
Hebrew.</p>
<p>On the title page of the Authorized Version of the New Testament
appears another falsehood: &ldquo;Translated out of the original
Greek.&rdquo; The <span class="corr" id="xd26e4208" title=
"Source: orginal">original</span> Greek of the New Testament, it is
claimed, belongs to the first century. The &ldquo;original Greek&rdquo;
out of which our version was translated is less than 500 years old. The
Greek version from which it was translated was made by Erasmus in 1516.
Referring to the materials employed by Erasmus in the preparation of
his work, the Rev. Alexander Roberts, D. D., in his &ldquo;Companion to
the Revised Version of the English New Testament,&rdquo; a work which
the Committee on Revision delegated him to write and which was
approved, makes the following admissions:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Gospels he principally used a cursive MS. of the
fifteenth or sixteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the Acts and Epistles he chiefly followed <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb171" href="#pb171" name="pb171">171</a>]</span>a
cursive MS. of the thirteenth or fourteenth century.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the Apocalypse he had only one mutilated
manuscript.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are words in the professed original for which no divine
authority can be pleaded, but which are entirely due to the learning
and imagination of Erasmus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Little do Christians realize how much of the Bible is due to the
imagination of theologians.</p>
<p>In view of the difficulties that I have mentioned, if the
translators had earnestly tried to give us a faithful translation of
the Bible their work would have teemed with imperfections. But they did
not even attempt to give us a faithful translation. We know that in
numerous instances they purposely mistranslated its words. A hundred
examples might be cited. One will suffice&mdash;<i>sheol</i>.</p>
<p>The translators themselves ought to be the best judges of each
other&rsquo;s work. Of Beza&rsquo;s New Testament, Castalio says:
&ldquo;It would require a large volume to mark down the multitude of
errors which swarm in Beza&rsquo;s translation.&rdquo; Of
Castalio&rsquo;s translation, Beza says: &ldquo;It is sacrilegious,
wicked, and downright pagan.&rdquo; Reviewing Luther&rsquo;s Bible,
Zwingle writes: &ldquo;Thou corruptest, O Luther, the Word of God. Thou
art known to be an open and notorious perverter of the Holy
Scriptures.&rdquo; Luther, in turn, calls the translators of
Zwingle&rsquo;s Bible &ldquo;a set of fools, anti-Christs, and
impostors.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb172" href="#pb172"
name="pb172">172</a>]</span></p>
<p>Our Authorized Version is certainly as faulty as any of the above,
and its translators have been the recipients of as severe criticisms as
those quoted. The Committee on Revision, while compelled to treat it
respectfully, declared against its infallibility in the following
words: &ldquo;The studied variety adopted by the translators of 1611
has produced a degree of inconsistency that cannot be reconciled with
the principles of faithfulness&rdquo; (Preface to N. V.).</p>

<h3 class="main">Different Versions Contain Different Books.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">That the charges that I have made concerning the
corruptions of the text of the Bible are true, one fact alone amply
proves&mdash;its many discordant versions and translations. Hundreds
have perished, all of them differing from the original and differing
from each other. A hundred still exist; no two of them alike. Excepting
the English versions, which are mostly revisions of the same version,
scarcely two of the principal versions contain the same books.</p>
<p>The received Hebrew contains 39 books (22 as divided), the Samaritan
6 (some copies but 5); the Septuagint about 50. Of the Christian
versions of the Old Testament, some contain the Apocryphal books,
others do not. The Gothic and Ethiopic versions exclude a part of the
canonical books.</p>
<p>The Syriac New Testament contains but 22 books; the Italic 24 (some
copies 25); the Egyptian 26; the Vulgate 27. The Ethiopic omits a
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb173" href="#pb173" name=
"pb173">173</a>]</span>canonical book and includes an apocryphal book.
The Sinaitic and Alexandrian manuscripts each contain 29 books. Each
contains two apocryphal books, but the books are not the same.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic and the Greek Catholic Bibles do not contain the
same number of books. The Roman Catholic and the Protestant Bibles do
not contain the same number; the Roman Catholic contains 75, the
Protestant 66.</p>

<p>The early Christian versions and manuscripts contain an immense
number of different readings, at least 150,000. Dr. Mill discovered
80,000 different readings in the New Testament alone.</p>
<p>Origen, writing in the third century, says: &ldquo;There is a vast
difference betwixt the several editions of the scripture, happening
either through the carelessness of the transcribers, or else the
forwardness of some who pretend to correct and adulterate the
scripture&rdquo; (Commentary on St. Matthew).</p>
<p>Modern versions do not agree. The readings of the Catholic and
Protestant versions are quite unlike: The Protestant versions
themselves contain a great variety of readings. The New <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb176" href="#pb176" name=

the Authorized Version. The committee that prepared it was governed by
this rule: &ldquo;To introduce as few alterations as possible into the
text of the Authorized Version consistent with faithfulness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How many alterations were made? <i>More than one hundred
thousand!</i></p>
<p>The following are some of the changes made in the New Testament:</p>

Lord&rsquo;s Prayer. The prayer we learned contains sixty-six words.

<h3 class="main">Different Copies of the Same Version Differ.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Different copies of the same version contain different
readings. St. Jerome&rsquo;s version was declared a forgery, because it
differed so much from the Italic version then in use. Jerome
anticipated the charge and met the objection in his preface addressed
to Pope Damasus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two things are my comfort under such a reproach: First, that
&rsquo;tis you, the Supreme Pontiff, that have put me upon the task;
and secondly, that by the confession even of the most envious, there
needs be some falsity where there is so much variety. If they say that
the Latin copies are to be credited, let them tell me which. <i>For
there are almost as many different copies as there are
manuscripts.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prof. Wilbur F. Steele, a noted Christian scholar, relates the
following relative to our own version: &ldquo;In 1848 there was such
confusion in the office of the American Bible Society, and such
impossibility of telling what should be the reading in many places,
that a man was set to work to bring order out of chaos. He took four
Bibles from as many leading Bible houses of England, a copy of the
American Bible Society, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb179" href=
"#pb179" name="pb179">179</a>]</span>and a copy of the original edition
of 1611, all claiming to be the same. These were carefully compared
throughout; every variation, no matter how minute, was noted. The
number of these variations was about 24,000&rdquo; (Central Christian
Advocate). <i>Twenty-four thousand variations found in six copies of
the same version!</i></p>
<p>Thus we see that different versions of the Bible do not contain the
same books; different versions of the same book do not contain the same
readings, while even different copies of the same versions disagree.
Which is the word of God?</p>
<p>If the Bible had originally consisted of authentic and credible
documents its credibility would have been greatly impaired by these
wholesale corruptions of the transcribers and translators. But if we
had the originals, it is doubtful whether their credibility would be
much greater than these distorted copies. Enough remains to show the
general character of them, and this is bad. They consist mostly of
historical and biographical narratives, interwoven with legends, myths,
and fables; crude poetical compositions; the ravings of diseased
religious minds, called prophecies and revelations; and theological
dissertations, no two of which agree in their doctrines. A few of the
books possess genuine merit and deserve a place among the literary
treasures of the world, but all of them are fallible.</p>
<p>Remarkable, as coming from a theological professor, but fraught with
truth and confirmatory <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb180" href=
"#pb180" name="pb180">180</a>]</span>of the statements made in this
chapter, are these words of Professor Steele:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evidently every letter of the English Bible has not been
miraculously watched over. He who has neither eyes nor conscience may
affirm it, but persons provided with these can not. If the affirmer
hedges by saying he did not refer to translations but to the
&lsquo;original,&rsquo; we note that (1) translations are the only
thing most people have to go to heaven on; and (2) that scholars of
truth and conscience find equally as much fault with the
&lsquo;original.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are hundreds, if not thousands, of places in which the
scholar finds conflicting testimony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In discussing the credibility of the Bible the question of
authenticity will, for the most part, be waived. With Christians all of
its books are genuine&mdash;the writings of those to whom they are
ascribed&mdash;and for the sake of argument, as well as convenience,
these ascribed authors will be recognized. <span class=

<h2 class="main">TWO COSMOGONIES OF GENESIS.</h2>

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">A stereotyped claim of Bible believers is this:
&ldquo;The account of creation given in Genesis is in harmony with the
accepted teachings of science.&rdquo; But which account? In the opening
chapters of Genesis are presented two ancient poems, written by
different authors. The first comprises the first chapter and the first
three verses of the second chapter; the second comprises the remainder
of the second chapter. Each poem contains a cosmogony. But neither of
them agrees with the demonstrated truths of science. Above all, they do
not agree with each other. The points of disagreement are many, chief
of which are the following:</p>

uniformly &ldquo;Elohim&rdquo; (the gods), translated

<p>In the second, the appellation of Deity is uniformly &ldquo;Jehovah
(Yahweh) Elohim,&rdquo; translated &ldquo;Lord God.&rdquo; This term

its present form at least, is not so much to explain the creation of

Sabbath. It belongs to the Priestly code, and one of the chief pillars
of priestcraft is the Sabbath.</p>
<p>The second contains no recognition of the Sabbath. The chief purpose
of this account of the creation, if we include the third chapter, which
is really a continuation of it, is to establish the doctrine of the
Fall of Man.</p>

<p>To establish the credibility and divine origin of Genesis it is
necessary not merely to harmonize its theories with science, but to
reconcile its statements with each other. The latter is as impossible
as the former. Dean Stanley, in his Memorial Sermon on Sir Charles
Lyell at Westminster Abbey, made this frank admission:</p>

<p>When the Flood began Noah was 599 years (one month and seventeen
days) old; when it ended he was exactly 600 years old.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that Methuselah <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb191" href="#pb191" name="pb191">191</a>]</span>died
before the Flood. If the foregoing passages be correct, he did not, as
will be shown by the following:</p>
<p>1. From the birth of Lamech to the beginning of the Flood was 182
years + 599 = 781 years; and from the birth of Lamech to the end of the
Flood was 182 years + 600 years = 782 years. If Methuselah lived after
he begat Lamech 782 years, he lived until the end of the Flood.</p>
<p>2. From the birth of Methuselah to the beginning of the Flood was
187 years + 182 years + 599 years = 968 years. From the birth of
Methuselah to the end of the Flood was 187 years + 182 years + 600
years = 969 years. At the commencement of the Flood he was but 968
years old, and not until the end of it was he 969.</p>
<p>3. From the birth of Methuselah to the death of Noah was 187 years +
182 years + 950 years = 1319 years. As Noah died 350 years after the
Flood, from the birth of Methuselah to the end of the Flood was 1319
years - 350 years = 969 years. If he lived 969 years, he lived until
the end of the Flood.</p>
<p>As Methuselah was not one of the eight persons that went into the
ark, where was he during the Flood?</p>
<p>According to the Septuagint Genesis, the Flood occurred fourteen
years before the death of Methuselah.</p>

<p class="first">Much of the Bible is devoted to events which are
narrated but once. These records may be true, or they may be false. We
may question their truthfulness, but it is difficult to demonstrate
their falsity. Had all the events of the Bible been recorded but once
its credibility could the more easily be maintained. But wherever two
or more accounts of the same events occur, such as in Kings and
Chronicles, where two histories of the Jewish Kings are given, and in
the Four Gospels, where four biographies of Jesus are given, we find
them so filled with discrepancies as to make them unworthy of
credit.</p>

<p>The foregoing epitome of Jewish history, gleaned from 1 and 2 Kings,
is presented in order that the reader may the more readily understand
the following solutions (based upon statements that appear in these
books) to the question that forms the topic of this chapter&mdash;When
did Jehoshaphat die?</p>
<p>Jehoshaphat is represented as one of Judah&rsquo;s best and greatest
kings. He did &ldquo;that which was right in the eyes of the
Lord.&rdquo; &ldquo;The Lord was with Jehoshaphat.&rdquo; &ldquo;And
Jehoshaphat waxed great.&rdquo; &ldquo;And he had riches and honor in
abundance.&rdquo; He died at the age of sixty, after a reign of
twenty-five years. Ahaziah, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb216" href=
"#pb216" name="pb216">216</a>]</span>king of Israel, is represented as
a very wicked king. &ldquo;He did evil in the sight of the Lord.&rdquo;
&ldquo;For he served Baal, and worshiped him, and provoked to anger the
Lord.&rdquo; Elijah prophesied his early death, which came after a
brief reign of two years. The last chapter of the first book of Kings
chronicles the reign and death of Judah&rsquo;s king, Jehoshaphat; the
first chapter of the second book of Kings records the reign and death
of Israel&rsquo;s king, Ahaziah. Now when did Jehoshaphat die? Did he
die before or after Ahaziah died?</p>

But one of them can <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb227" href="#pb227"

necessarily be incorrect. And yet I challenge the theologian to
demonstrate the incorrectness of one of them without at the same time
demonstrating the fallibility of the Bible and its unreliability as a
historical record.</p>

<h3 class="main">Notes and Explanations.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The history of Judah&rsquo;s and of Israel&rsquo;s
sovereigns is recorded in Kings and repeated in Chronicles. Had I used
both Kings and Chronicles in the preparation of this chapter, the
number of various answers would have been increased. Some Christian
scholars, however, admit that Chronicles is not entirely free from
errors, while Kings, on the other hand, is denominated a &ldquo;marvel
of accuracy.&rdquo; To avoid any objections that might be raised were
Chronicles used&mdash;to assail only that which is deemed
unassailable&mdash;I have confined myself to Kings.</p>
<p>To prevent confusion in regard to names, the reader should remember
that Israel had two kings named Jeroboam, and that Israel and Judah
each had kings named Ahaziah, Jehoram, and Jehoash. In Israel Jehoram
succeeded Ahaziah; in Judah, Ahaziah succeeded Jehoram. The contracted
form of <i>Jehoram</i> is <i>Joram</i>, and of <i>Jehoash</i>,
<i>Joash</i>. Both forms are used. <i>Azariah</i> is also called
<i>Uzziah</i>.</p>
<p>In computing time, ordinal numbers are reckoned the same as cardinal
numbers. It may be urged that the phrase, &ldquo;in the eighteenth
year,&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb228" href="#pb228" name=
"pb228">228</a>]</span>does not denote the full period of eighteen
completed years. In justification of the method pursued, I may say that
it is not only the method generally followed by chronologists, but it
is the method authorized by the Bible. See <a class="biblink xd26e45"

2 Chron. xvi, 13</a>. Its adoption simplifies the form without
increasing the number of solutions.</p>
<p>To reconcile other discrepancies, some Bible chronologists have
assumed an interregnum of eleven years between the reigns of Jeroboam
II. and Zachariah, and another of nine years between Pekah and Hosea.
The language of the Bible utterly precludes these assumptions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jeroboam slept with his fathers, even with the kings of
Israel, and Zachariah his son reigned in his stead&rdquo; (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2014:29&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings xiv, 29</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against Pekah
the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned in his
stead&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kgs%2015:30&amp;version=NRSV">2
Kings xv, 30</a>).</p>
<p>That these interregnums did not occur, nor indeed any interregnums
between the reigns of Israel&rsquo;s kings, is attested by Josephus,
who by Christians is esteemed an authority second only to the writers
of the Scriptures. The ninth book of his &ldquo;Antiquities&rdquo;
bears the following title: &ldquo;Containing the interval of one
hundred and fifty-seven years from the death of Ahab to the captivity
of the ten tribes.&rdquo; This forbids the idea of any interregnum.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb229" href="#pb229" name=
"pb229">229</a>]</span></p>
<p>But if it could be shown that these or other interregnums really did
occur, the fact would increase rather than diminish the difficulties
connected with the solution of this question.</p>
<p>We search the writings of Bible commentators in vain for an
explanation or attempted reconciliation of many of the conflicting
statements to be found in the passages that I have quoted. These
exegetes have either been ignorant of their existence, or have
purposely ignored them. Some of the more noticeable ones they have
attempted to reconcile; but the explanations offered are of such a
character as to make it seemingly impossible for an honest scholar to
advance them, or an intelligent reader to accept them.</p>
<p>These pretended reconciliations have been abridged, and, in the
shape of marginal notes, transferred to the popular editions of the
Bible. Where different and conflicting dates are assigned for the
commencement of a king&rsquo;s reign, opposite the first will be found
such explanatory notes as &ldquo;prorex,&rdquo; &ldquo;viceroy,&rdquo;
&ldquo;in consort,&rdquo; or &ldquo;in partnership with his
father;&rdquo; and opposite the last, &ldquo;began to reign
alone;&rdquo; and all this without a word or hint, either in the Bible
or elsewhere, to authorize it.</p>
<p>The demonstration of a single error in the Bible destroys the dogmas
of its divinity and infallibility. Yet notwithstanding this single
error, or even twenty errors, it might still be valuable as a
historical record. But when it <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb230"
href="#pb230" name="pb230">230</a>]</span>can be demonstrated that it
abounds with glaring contradictions, that its every chapter teems with
flagrant errors, it is utterly unworthy of credit, and must be rejected
even as a human record of events. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb231"

<h2 class="main">INSPIRED NUMBERS.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the second chapter of Ezra is given a register of
the Jews who returned from Babylon to Jerusalem. The register begins
with these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now these are the children of the province that went up out
of the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto Babylon, and
came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one unto his
city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the seventh chapter of Nehemiah, beginning with the sixth verse,
is a copy of the same register. Nehemiah says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I found a register of the genealogy of them which came up
at the first, and found written therein,</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the children of the province, that went up out of
the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar
the king of Babylon had carried away, and came again to Jerusalem and
to Judah, every one unto his city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then follows in each a list of the families <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb232" href="#pb232" name="pb232">232</a>]</span>with
the number of persons belonging to them. But in transcribing the
numbers, either Ezra or Nehemiah has made many errors. A careful
examination reveals no less than twenty, as shown by the following:</p>

<p>In the above table are twenty discrepancies. Twenty errors in
forty-three numerical statements is a bad showing for an infallible
record.</p>
<p>Ezra and Nehemiah both state that the whole congregation, exclusive
of the servants and singers, numbered 42,360. Yet the sum total of each
is much less than this, that of Ezra being but 29,818, and <a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Neh%2031:089&amp;version=NRSV">
Nehemiah, 31,089</a>.</p>
<p>In the number of domestic animals Ezra and Nehemiah agree. In the
oblations they disagree. According to Ezra they gave 61,000 drams of
gold, 5,000 pounds of silver, and 100 priests&rsquo; garments.
According to Nehemiah they gave in all 41,000 drams of gold, 4,200
pounds of silver, and 597 priests&rsquo; garments.</p>
<p>When bibliolaters affirm that there is not one error in the Bible,
refer them to this register, where in two chapters may be found two
dozen errors. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb238" href="#pb238" name=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The more intelligent of orthodox Christians admit that
the Bible as a whole is not infallible and divine, but claim that it
contains a divine revelation&mdash;that a part of it is the work of God
and a part the work of man. And yet they cannot separate the one from
the other, cannot agree as to which is divine and which human.
Concerning this claim Prof. Goldwin Smith writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we are told there are in the Old Testament scriptures
both a human and a divine element, we must ask by what test the divine
is to be distinguished from the human? Nobody would have thought of
&lsquo;partial inspiration&rsquo; except as an expedient to cover
retreat. We but tamper with our own understanding and consciences by
such attempts at once to hold on and let go; to retain the shadow of
the belief when the substance has passed away. Far better it is,
whatever the effort may cost, honestly to admit that the sacred books
of the Hebrews, granting their superiority to the sacred books of other
nations, are, like the sacred books of other nations, the works of man
and not of God.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb239" href=
"#pb239" name="pb239">239</a>]</span></p>
<p>Others admit the fallibility and human origin of the Old Testament
and claim infallibility and divinity for the New Testament alone. But
they cannot consistently claim infallibility and divinity for the New
and not for the Old. The New Testament is based upon the Old. If the
foundation be fallible the superstructure must be fallible also. Both
have been declared canonical; both are bound in the same volume and
labeled Holy Bible. The chief apostles declared the writings of the Old
Testament to be divine, a claim they did not make for the writings of
the New. Besides, the New Testament is as full of errors as the
Old.</p>
<p>It has been shown that the Four Gospels are not genuine&mdash;that
they were not written by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. It is to their
credit that they were not. A knowledge of the fact relieves the
Apostles and their companions of a very discreditable imputation. Were
four witnesses to testify in a court of justice and contradict each
other as the Evangelists do, they would be prosecuted for perjury.</p>
<p>In another work five hundred errors to be found in the Four Gospels
will be exposed. In this chapter twenty, selected largely at random,
will suffice to disprove the credibility of these books:</p>

<p>The first time I read Paine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Age of Reason&rdquo; I
was amazed to learn that the Bible contains as many errors as he
exposes. But when a little later I made a more thorough study and
analysis of the Pentateuch, the so-called historical books of the Old
Testament, and the Four Gospels, I found that Paine had only selected
here and there one of a multitude of errors&mdash;that in a single book
of the Bible were to be found more errors than he had cited from its
sixty-six. The briefest expos&eacute; of all the errors of the Bible
would require a larger volume than the Bible itself. And yet, this book
which contains more errors than any other book in Christendom, is the
only book for which Christians claim inerrancy. <span class=

<p class="first">It is popularly supposed that Jesus and his twelve
Apostles formulated the doctrines of Christianity and founded the
Christian church. Paul was the real author of this religion and the
founder of the church.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul: and when
he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass,
that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught
much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in
Antioch&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

<p>Jesus Christ was a Jew. Peter, John, James, and the other Apostles
in Palestine were not Christians, but Jews&mdash;orthodox
Jews&mdash;who differed from other Jews chiefly in accepting Jesus
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb248" href="#pb248" name=

followers were the first Christians. The Dutch critics frankly admit
that &ldquo;Christianity has to thank him more than any other for its
existence,&rdquo; that he was &ldquo;the founder of the Christian
church,&rdquo; and that &ldquo;without him it would have remained an
insignificant or forgotten Jewish sect&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol.
III. pp. 20, 642, 643).</p>

<h2 class="main">THE BIBLE AND HISTORY.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">About one-half of the books of the Bible purport to
be, to a considerable extent at least, historical. But from Genesis to
Revelation there is scarcely a book which can be accepted as a reliable
record of events. Nearly all of them abound with manifest absurdities,
exaggerations, and contradictions. Their authors, for the most part,
deal with matters concerning which the ancient profane historians take
no cognizance; and this, in a measure, conceals their errors. But when
they do refer to known historical events, they exhibit such an
ignorance of the facts, or such a desire to pervert them, as to destroy
their credibility. In this chapter will be presented some
&ldquo;sacred&rdquo; history which reason rejects or the demonstrated
facts of profane history disprove.</p>

reliable historical and chronological record of events from the
Creation down to the universally accepted dates of profane history. And
yet between the three versions of the Jewish Bible there is an utter
disagreement. The creation of the world, according to these versions,

<p>The Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb262" href="#pb262" name=

incredibly brief space of time. It was after midnight when Moses was
ordered to notify his people to depart. Before morning they were all
<i>en route</i> from Rameses to the Red Sea, which they reached in
three days and crossed in a few hours.</p>
<p>As there were 600,000 men, the total number of persons must have
been nearly 3,000,000. Three millions is a number easily spoken and
quickly written. But neither the author of this story nor those who
accept it as history have the slightest conception of its meaning. They
evidently think that three million people&mdash;old and young; men,
women, and children; the sick and the lame, together with their flocks
and herds, their household effects and provisions&mdash;could be moved
with the celerity of a few hundred men. When Napoleon crossed the
Nieman in 1812, it took his army of trained soldiers, inured to
hardships and accustomed to rapid marches, three days and nights to
cross the river in close file on three bridges. Had his army been as
large as this body of Israelites, to have crossed the river on one
bridge, allowing the necessary time for rest, would have taken six
months. It would have required months to notify, assemble, and organize
this vast population of slaves in readiness for their migration. And
when the journey began, if the head of the column had left Rameses in
the spring the rear of the column would not have been able to move
before autumn. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb263" href="#pb263" name=

<p>The above are three versions of the same passage. The first is a
correct translation of the passage as it appears in the Hebrew. It is a
part of one of the two discordant narratives used by the compiler of
Samuel. The compiler of Chronicles saw the discrepancy and interpolated
the words &ldquo;Lahmi the brother of.&rdquo; Our translators
interpolated the words &ldquo;<i>the brother of</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Critics admit that if the killing of Goliath is a historical event,
which is improbable, it was Elkanah, and not David, who slew him. The
story of David and Goliath given by the other narrator in 1 Samuel is a
myth. This writer says: &ldquo;And David took the head of the
Philistine, and brought it to Jerusalem,&rdquo; evidently believing
that the Israelites then occupied Jerusalem, whereas the duel between
David and Goliath is said to have occurred 1062 <span class=

Israelites did not occur until 1047 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>,

<p>The Bible is largely a medley of fables, mythologies, and legends.
These legends contain a modicum of truth&mdash;how much cannot be
determined. The reliable historian faithfully presents the facts
contained in the materials at his command. These so-called sacred
historians do not. With them history is secondary to theology and made
subservient to it. Every event is represented as a special act of
divine Providence and is tortured to uphold and serve their theological
notions. Referring to the author or compiler of Judges, Dr. Oort says:
&ldquo;The writer has drawn most of his narratives from trustworthy
sources&#8202;&hellip;. Our gratitude to him would indeed be still
greater than it is, if he had given us all that he found in his
authorities unmixed and unaltered. But to an Israelite historian this
seems to have been a simple impossibility&rdquo; (Bible for Learners,
Vol. I., p. 363). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb271" href="#pb271"

principles of science and the teachings of the Bible.&rdquo;&mdash;Dr.
Cheever.</p>
<p>Bibliolaters, unacquainted with the principles of science, and
scientists unacquainted with the teachings of the Bible, may accept
this statement; those conversant with both cannot. In the Bible a
thousand scientific errors may be found. The limits of this work
preclude a presentation of them all. Enough will be given, however, to
show that the teachings of the Bible conflict with the teachings of the
ten principal sciences&mdash;Astronomy, Geology, Geography, Botany,
Zoology, Ethnology, Physiology, Chemistry, Physics, and
Mathematics.</p>

<p>The cause is supposed to precede the effect; but here the effect
precedes the cause. Light and darkness, morning and evening, day and
night exist before the sun.</p>
<p>The Bible teaches us that the earth is older than the sun; science
teaches us that the sun is older than the earth.</p>
<p>In the creation of the universe God devoted five-sixths of his time
to the creation of this little world of ours, while but a fragment of
the remaining time was needed to create the countless worlds that exist
outside of our solar system. Five brief words, &ldquo;He made the stars
also,&rdquo; record the history of their creation.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the oldest star is less than six thousand
years old. What says the scientist?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have observed stars, of which the light, it can be proved,
must take two millions of years to reach this earth.&rdquo;&mdash;Sir
William Herschel.</p>

<p>Luther, accepting the Bible and rejecting science, wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fool [Copernicus] wishes to reverse the entire science of
Astronomy. But sacred Scripture tells us that Joshua commanded the sun
to stand still and not the earth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In six days the Lord made heaven and earth&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2020:11&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xx, 11</a>).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the earth was created <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb274" href="#pb274" name="pb274">274</a>]</span>in
six days about six thousand years ago. Geology tells us that the earth
was old six million years ago.</p>
<p>To make room for the earth&rsquo;s development, theologians now
contend that a vast period of time elapsed between the work recorded in
the first verse and in those following. To this Bishop Colenso
replies:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are plainly taught in the book of Genesis, according to
the simple, straightforward meaning of the words, that Elohim created
the heaven and the earth in the beginning of these six days&mdash;that
is, taking into account the chronological data of the Bible, about six
thousand years ago&rdquo; (The Pentateuch, Part IV, p. 94).</p>
<p>Again, theologians claim that these six days were not six literal
days, but six long epochs of time. The Rev. Moses Stuart, Professor of
Sacred Literature in Andover Theological Seminary, one of the ablest
Hebrew scholars, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the sacred writer in <a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%201&amp;version=NRSV">Genesis
i</a> says, the first day, the second day, etc., there can be no
possible doubt&mdash;none&#8202;&hellip;. What puts this beyond all
question in philology is that the writer says specifically, the evening
and the morning were the first day, the second day, etc. Now, is an
evening and a morning a period of some thousands of years? Is it, in
any sense, when so employed, an indefinite period? The answer is so
plain and certain that I need not repeat it. If Moses has given us an
erroneous account of the creation, so be it. Let it come <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb275" href="#pb275" name="pb275">275</a>]</span>out,
and let us leave the whole. But do not let us turn aside his language
to get rid of difficulties that we may have in our
speculations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Jewish scholar, Dr. Kalisch, not only rejects this
interpretation of the word <i>day</i>, but admits that it would not
reconcile Genesis with science if allowed. He says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The device that the days denote epochs is not only arbitrary,
but ineffective, for the six epochs of the Mosaic creation correspond
in no manner with the gradual formation of cosmos.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Genesis the creation of organic life occupied but three
of these six days. The order of creation for these three days, or
periods, is as follows: 1. (3d day) Land plants; 2. (5th day) aquatic
animals, birds; 3. (6th day) Mammals, reptiles, man.</p>
<p>Is this confirmed by science? Passing Lyell by, let us cite our more
orthodox Dana. Dr. Dana, who professed to believe that the study of
Geology tended &ldquo;to strengthen faith in the Book of books,&rdquo;
gives the several geological ages, together with the successive
appearances of organic life, as follows: 1. Arch&aelig;an
Age&mdash;Lowest marine life, if any; 2. Silurian
Age&mdash;Invertebrates, marine plants; 3. Devonian Age&mdash;Fish,
earliest appearance of land plants; 4. Carboniferous
Age&mdash;Luxuriant vegetation, lowest forms of reptiles; 5. Reptilian
Age&mdash;Highest forms of reptiles; 6. Tertiary Age&mdash;Birds,
mammals; 7. <span class="corr" id="xd26e8961" title=
"Source: Quatenary">Quaternary</span> Age&mdash;Man.</p>
<p>Even Dana cannot reconcile Genesis with <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb276" href="#pb276" name=
"pb276">276</a>]</span>Geology. Genesis tells us that the earliest
organic life was terrestrial vegetation; Geology tells us that ages of
organic life passed before terrestrial plants appeared. Genesis tells
us that fish and fowls were created at the same time; Geology tells us
that the finny tribes existed ages before the feathered tribes
appeared. Genesis tells us that mammals and reptiles were created at
the same time; Geology tells us that while reptiles existed in the
Carboniferous age, mammals did not appear until the close of the
Reptilian age. Genesis tells us that birds appeared before reptiles;
Geology tells us that reptiles existed first. Genesis tells us that
life existed first upon the land; Geology tells us that the sea teemed
with animal and vegetable life ages before it appeared upon the
land.</p>
<p>The seven ages of Geology comprise twenty-five geological periods.
Genesis recognizes but six periods in the creation of the entire
universe; Geology recognizes twenty-five periods in the formation of
earth&rsquo;s crust alone. According to Bible chronology, the universe
is less than six thousand years old; according to Geology, the mere
existence of life upon earth&rsquo;s crust, which is as but a day
compared with the existence of the universe, is probably nearly fifty
millions of years. Dr. Dana says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If time from the commencement of the Silurian included 48
millions of years, which some geologists would pronounce much too low
an estimate, the Paleozoic part [Silurian, Devonian, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb277" href="#pb277" name="pb277">277</a>]</span>and
Carboniferous], according to the above ratio, would comprise 36
millions, the Mesozoic [Reptilian] 9 millions, and the Cenozoic
[Tertiary and Quaternary] 3 millions&rdquo; (Text Book of Geology, p.
329).</p>
<p>When Geology was in its infancy scientists attempted to reconcile
its teachings with the teachings of the Bible. No scientist worthy of
the name attempts to reconcile them now.</p>
<p>Writing over thirty years ago, Carl Vogt thus records the triumph of
Geology over Genesis:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is hardly twenty years since I learned from Agassiz:
transitional strata, pal&aelig;ozoic formations&mdash;kingdom of
fishes; there are no reptiles in this period, and cannot be any,
because it would be contrary to the plan of creation; secondary
formations (Trias, Jura, chalk)&mdash;kingdom of reptiles; there are no
mammals and cannot be any, for the same reason; tertiary
strata&mdash;kingdom of mammals; there are no men and cannot be any;
present creation&mdash;kingdom of man. What is become of this plan of
creation, with its exclusiveness? Reptiles in the Devonian strata,
reptiles in the coal, reptiles in the Dyas. Farewell, kingdom of fish!
Mammals in the Jura, mammals in Purbeck chalk, which some reckon as the
lowest chalk formation; good-by, kingdom of reptiles! Men in the
highest tertiary strata, men in the diluvial forms&mdash;<i>au
revoir</i>, kingdom of mammals!&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<h3 class="main">Ethnology.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">According to the Bible, all mankind have sprung from a
single pair created by God six thousand years ago. Science does not
admit that man is the result of a divine creative act, that all the
races have descended from a single pair, or that his existence here is
confined to the brief period of sixty centuries. She is not able to
tell yet, even approximately, when man&rsquo;s advent upon the earth
occurred, but she has long since proved the Biblical record false, and
shown that instead of his having occupied the earth but six thousand
years he has been here at the least from ten to fifty times six
thousand years.</p>
<p>Referring to the Biblical origin of man, Professor Huxley says:
&ldquo;Five-sixths of the public are taught this Adamitic monogenism as
if it were an established truth, and believe it. I do not; and I am not
acquainted with any man of science, or duly instructed person, who
does&rdquo; (Methods and Results of Ethnology).</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were giants in the earth in those days&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%206:4&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
vi, 4</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible, like the mythical records of other early nations,
represents the earth as peopled with a race of giants. Yet the stature
of man <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb284" href="#pb284" name=
"pb284">284</a>]</span>is as great to-day as it was five thousand years
ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty
years&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%205:5&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
v, 5</a>).</p>
<p>The Bible says that for a period of two thousand years men lived for
centuries, that at least seven patriarchs attained to an age of nearly
1,000 years. The Egyptian records of that period show that man&rsquo;s
longevity was no greater then than it is now.</p>
<p>Not only the size and age of men, but their numbers are exaggerated
by Bible writers. The Israelites, at the time they settled in
Palestine, numbered, it is claimed, two or three millions. Out of this
country, to make room for them, God cast &ldquo;seven nations greater
and mightier than&rdquo; the Israelite nation (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%207:1&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
vii, 1</a>). Palestine must then have sustained a population as great
as Spain does now with a territory thirty times as large.</p>
<p>The census of Israel and Judah, taken in the time of David, places
the number of warriors at 1,570,000 (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Ch%2021:5&amp;version=NRSV">1
Ch. xxi, 5). This makes the whole population twice as great as that of
Illinois with an area nine times as large as Palestine and a soil ten
times as fertile.</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;And the whole earth was of one language, and of one
speech&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2011:1&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xi, 1</a>):</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go down, and there confound their language, that they
may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech&rdquo; (<a class=

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2011:7&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xi, 7</a>).</p>
<p>The origin of the various languages of men is <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb285" href="#pb285" name="pb285">285</a>]</span>here
attributed to a miraculous confusion of tongues. Science shows that
languages had no such origin. Renan says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Far from placing unity at the beginning of language, it is
necessary to look at such a unity as the slow and tardy result of an
advanced civilization. In the beginning there were as many dialects as
families.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Bible account of the confusion of tongues is contradicted by
the preceding chapter of Genesis (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2010:5-31&amp;version=NRSV">x,

<p>Turning a river into blood, water into wine, flesh into salt, and
burning and grinding gold into powder and holding it in solution,
cannot be harmonized with the teachings of science.</p>
<p>But it is not merely to a few Biblical passages, to a few so-called
miraculous changes in the elements of nature, that the science of
chemistry is opposed. It is opposed to the entire Bible as a divine
revelation. The central ideas of this book, a Creator, a Providence,
and a Mediator, are all overthrown by this science.</p>
<p>Referring to this, Comte truthfully observes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;However imperfect our chemical science is, its development
has operated largely in the emancipation of the human mind. Its
opposition to all theological philosophy is marked by two general
facts, &hellip; first the prevision of phenomena, and next our
voluntary modification of them&rdquo; (Positive Philosophy, Book IV.,
chap. i).</p>
<p>&ldquo;In this way, Chemistry effectually discredits the notion of
the rule of Providential will among its phenomena. But there is another
way in <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb288" href="#pb288" name=

<p>The foregoing are but three of three hundred mathematical errors to
be found in the Bible.</p>
<p>It is not merely in a few unimportant scientific details, but in the
fundamental principles of the most important sciences&mdash;of
astronomy, of geology, of geography, and of man&mdash;that the Bible
errs. Its writers evince no divine knowledge of the facts of nature.
Their works exhibit the crude notions of the age in which they lived.
Some of their teachings are in harmony with the accepted truths of
Science; but these prove no more than a human origin. The wisest of
mankind do not know all; the most ignorant know something. While there
are phenomena <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb291" href="#pb291" name=
"pb291">291</a>]</span>too complex for the mind of a Newton or a Darwin
to grasp, there are others regarding which the first impressions of a
child are correct.</p>
<p>To assert that the Bible is in harmony with the teachings of Modern
Science is to assert that no advancement has been made in Science for
two thousand years, when all know that many of the most marvelous
scientific discoveries are less than two hundred years old. The
scientific attainments of Bible writers were not above those of the age
and country in which they lived, and probably far below; for the Bible
is largely the work of theologians, and theologians have ever been
behind their age in scientific knowledge. The mission of theologians is
not to advance, but to retard Science. They have waged a relentless but
ineffective warfare against it. In the words of Huxley:
&ldquo;Extinguished theologians lie about the cradle of every science,
as the strangled snakes beside that of Hercules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Hebrew Pentateuch,&rdquo; says Gerald Massey, &ldquo;has
not only retarded the growth of science for eighteen centuries, but the
ignorant believers in it as a book of revelation have tried to strangle
every science at its birth. There could be and was but little or no
progress in Astronomy, Geology, Biology, or Sociology until its
teachings were repudiated by the more enlightened among men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Bible and Science thus writes America&rsquo;s <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb292" href="#pb292" name=
"pb292">292</a>]</span>eminent scientist and author, Dr. John W.
Draper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to be regretted that the Christian church has burdened
itself with the defense of these books, and voluntarily made itself
answerable for their manifest contradictions and errors&#8202;&hellip;.
Still more, it is to be deeply regretted that the Pentateuch, a
production so imperfect as to be unable to stand the touch of modern
criticism, should be put forth as the arbiter of science&rdquo;
(Conflict Between Religion and Science, p. 225).</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world is not to be discovered through the vain traditions
that have brought down to us the opinions of men who lived in the
morning of civilization, nor in the dreams of mystics who thought that
they were inspired&rdquo; (Ibid, p. 33).</p>
<p>&ldquo;For her [Science] the volume of inspiration is the book of
Nature, of which the open scroll is ever spread forth before the eyes
of every man. Confronting all, it needs no societies for its
dissemination. Infinite in extent, eternal in duration, human ambition
and human fanaticism have never been able to tamper with it. On the
earth it is illustrated by all that is magnificent and beautiful, on
the heavens its letters are suns and worlds&rdquo; (Ib., p. 227).

<p class="first">&ldquo;Prophecy is a demonstration of divine
knowledge; as miracles, in the restricted acceptation of the word, are
a demonstration of divine power. Prophecies being true, revelation is
established as a fact.&rdquo;&mdash;Keith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The predictions respecting Christ are so clear, so detailed
and circumstantial, as to constitute together one of the most important
proofs of the inspiration of the Bible and of the truth of
Christianity.&rdquo;&mdash;Hitchcock.</p>
<p>A prophet, according to the orthodox and popular signification of
the term, is one who predicts. A prophecy is a prediction, and the
writings of the prophets are a collection of predictions regarding
future events. Prophet and prophecy, as used in the Bible, have no such
meaning. The prophet might make a prediction, just as any one may make
a prediction, but this was not necessarily any part of his office. The
functions of the prophet were those of preacher, poet, and musician.
There were not merely a score of them, but thousands of them. The more
talented prophets became <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb294" href=
"#pb294" name="pb294">294</a>]</span>authors&mdash;composed the poems,
recorded the history, and wrote the religious works of the Hebrews.
Some of these prophets were moral reformers&mdash;labored earnestly to
reform their people. The wicked were exhorted to forsake their sins,
and threatened with divine retribution if they did not. When their
countrymen were in bondage they consoled them with the promise that God
would liberate them. The oppressed and the captive longed for a
deliverer. The prophet gave utterance to these longings, and this gave
birth to the Messianic idea.</p>
<p>The more important of these so-called prophecies will now be
examined.</p>

evinced supernatural prescience on the part of the prophet. It is the
fate of cities to flourish for a time and then decay. The world
contains the ruins, not of Babylon alone, but of a thousand cities.</p>
<p>The enemies of Babylon wished for and hoped for its destruction. The
prophet voiced that wish and hope. Perhaps at that very moment the
victorious armies of the Persian were leveling its walls.</p>
<p>But this prophecy has not been literally fulfilled. Babylon was not
as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah; it has been inhabited; it has
been dwelt in from generation to generation; the Arabian has pitched
his tent there; shepherds have made their fold there; satyrs have not
danced there; dragons have not occupied her palaces; her days were
prolonged. The ancient glory of Babylon has faded, but a thriving city
still exists there, a standing refutation of the claim that
Isaiah&rsquo;s prophecy has been fulfilled.</p>

<p>It is now conceded by all critics that the book of Jeremiah, as a

"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Is%207:14&amp;version=NRSV">Isaiah
vii, 14</a>).</p>
<p>This is cited as a prophecy of Jesus Christ. The only thing in it
suggestive of the story of Jesus is the word &ldquo;virgin.&rdquo; The
word thus translated, however, does not necessarily mean virgin in the
common acceptation of this term, but simply &ldquo;young woman,&rdquo;
either married or single. Correct this error and the text reads:
&ldquo;Behold, a young woman shall conceive, and bear a son.&rdquo; All
that is suggestive of the miraculous conception vanishes. But this is
not the only error. The forms of the verbs have been changed. The
passage should read as follows: &ldquo;Behold, a young woman is with
child and beareth a son.&rdquo; The woman was with child when the
prophet wrote. This precludes the possibility of a reference to Jesus
Christ. Not only this, the context utterly forbids it. All the events
named by the prophet, including the birth of this child, occurred more
than seven hundred years before Christ.</p>
<p>Michaelis rejects this prophecy. He says: &ldquo;I <span class=

this is the name whereby they shall call themselves: The Eternal is our

<p>In order to make a Messianic prophecy of this passage and give it
effect, no less than eight pieces of trickery are employed: 1. The word
&ldquo;branch&rdquo; is made to begin with a capital letter. 2. The
word &ldquo;king&rdquo; also begins with a capital. 3. &ldquo;The
name&rdquo; is rendered &ldquo;<i>his</i> name.&rdquo; 4. The pronoun
&ldquo;they,&rdquo; relating to the people of Judah and Israel, is
changed to &ldquo;he.&rdquo; 5. The word &ldquo;Eternal&rdquo; is
translated &ldquo;Lord.&rdquo; 6. &ldquo;The Lord our

contents at the head of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb301" href=

<p>The meaning of Shiloh being somewhat obscure, it was made to apply

<p>It is claimed that &ldquo;week&rdquo; here means a period of seven
years, and assumed, of course, that by Messiah is meant Christ. Seven
weeks and three score and two weeks are sixty-nine weeks, or 483 years,
the time that was to elapse from the command to rebuild Jerusalem to
the coming of Christ, if the prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
<p>The decree of Cyrus to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple was made 536
<span class="sc">B.C.</span> According to the accepted chronology,
Christ was born 4 <span class="sc">B.C.</span> From the decree of
Cyrus, then, to the coming of Christ was 532 years instead of 483, a
period of seven weeks, or forty-nine years, longer than that named by
Daniel.</p>
<p>Ezra, the priest, went to Jerusalem 457 <span class="sc">B.C.</span>
This event, however, had nothing whatever to do with the decree for
rebuilding Jerusalem and the temple. It occurred 79 years after the
decree was issued, and 58 years after the temple was finished. But a
searcher for Messianic prophecies found that from the time of Ezra to
the beginning of Christ&rsquo;s ministry was about 483 years, or 69
prophetic weeks; and notwithstanding there was a deficiency of 79 years
at one end of the period, and an excess of 30 years at the other, it
was declared to fit exactly. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb303" href=

<p>The following, relative to Bible prophecies, is from the pen of
William Rathbone Greg:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A prophecy, in the ordinary acceptation of the term,
signifies a prediction of future events which could not have been
foreseen by human sagacity, and the knowledge of which was
supernaturally communicated to the prophet. It is clear, therefore,
that in order to establish the claim of any anticipatory statement,
promise, or denunciation to the rank and title of a prophecy, four
points must be ascertained with precision, viz., what the event was to
which the alleged prediction was intended to refer; that the prediction
was uttered in specific, not vague, language before the event; that the
event took place specifically, not loosely, as predicted; and that it
could not have been foreseen by human sagacity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probably not too much to affirm that we have no
instance in the prophetical books of the Old Testament of a prediction
in the case of which we possess, at once and combined, clear and
unsuspicious proof of the date, the precise event predicted, the exact
circumstances of that event, and the inability of human sagacity to
foresee it. There is no case in which we can say with
certainty&mdash;even where it is reasonable to suppose that the
prediction was uttered before <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb305"
href="#pb305" name="pb305">305</a>]</span>the event&mdash;that the
narrative has not been tampered with to suit the prediction, or the

<p>These Bible stories, which Christians profess to believe, are
unworthy of serious consideration. They are not historical, but
fabulous. A miracle is a fable. The miraculous is impossible; the
impossible untrue. If miracles were possible and necessary in that age
they are possible and necessary now. This is an age of unbelief. Give
us <i>one</i> miracle and we will believe. Let Jesus visit earth again
and with his divine touch revivify the inanimate dust of Lincoln and
give him back to the nation that loved him so well, and we will
acknowledge his divinity and believe that the Bible is inspired. Had he
restored to life the decaying corpse of Lazarus the Jews would have
believed in him. The Jews did not believe in him, therefore the miracle
was not performed. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb316" href="#pb316"

<p>The divine origin of the Bible cannot be established by miracles
because the possibility of a miracle itself cannot be established. In
the language of Hume, &ldquo;a miracle is a violation of the laws of
nature; and as a firm and unalterable experience has established these
laws, the proof against a miracle, from the very nature of the fact, is
as entire as any argument from experience can possibly be
imagined.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb317" href="#pb317"

<p>While many of these texts are simply metaphorical allusions to a
Deity, as a whole they clearly reveal the anthropomorphic conception
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb326" href="#pb326" name=
"pb326">326</a>]</span>of God that prevailed among Bible writers
generally. This God was represented as a being of power and glory, yet
a being possessing the form, the attributes, and the limitations of
man. He was a colossal despot&mdash;a king of kings.</p>
<p>The God of the Bible is a product of the human imagination. God did
not make man in God&rsquo;s image, as claimed, but man made God in
man&rsquo;s image. Man is not the creation of God, but God is the
creation of man.</p>
<p>This God who was supposed to have created the universe out of
nothing has himself gradually been resolved into nothingness in the
minds of his votaries, and to-day, enthroned in the brain of
Christendom, there reigns a mere phantom, &ldquo;without body, parts,
or passions&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb327" href="#pb327"

<h2 class="main">THE BIBLE NOT A MORAL GUIDE.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">We are asked to accept the Bible as the revealed will
of an all-powerful, all-wise and all-just God. We are asked to revere
it beyond all other books, to make a fetich of it. Above all, we are
asked to accept it as a divine and infallible moral guide. Christians
profess to accept it as such; and many who are not
Christians&mdash;many who reject the authenticity of the most of it,
and who doubt the credibility of much of it&mdash;parrot-like, repeat
the claims of supernaturalists, dwell upon its &ldquo;beautiful moral
teachings,&rdquo; and abet the efforts of the clergy to place it in our
public schools, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it is not in any
sense a moral guide.</p>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">What is Morality?</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">What is morality? Paley, by many considered the chief
of modern Christian authorities, basing his conception of morality on
the Bible, <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb330" href="#pb330" name=
"pb330">330</a>]</span>defines it as &ldquo;the doing good to mankind,
in obedience to the will of God [as revealed in the Bible], and for the
sake of everlasting happiness [and to escape everlasting
misery].&rdquo; Supernaturalism and selfishness are thus its sole
principles; supernaturalism being its source and selfishness being the
motive for its observance. Here virtue does not bring its own reward,
the will of God is not omnipotent, and mankind, like a spoiled child,
must be bribed or frightened to obey its precepts.</p>
<p>This is the Christian conception of morality. But it is a false
conception. Morality is not supernatural and divine, but natural and
human. It is purely utilitarian. Utility, regardless of the will of
God, is its all-pervading principle. Whatever is beneficial to man is
right, is moral; and whatever is injurious to him is wrong, is immoral.
The end and aim of moral conduct, according to Hobbes, is
self-preservation and happiness; not everlasting happiness in another
world, as taught by Paley, but life-lasting happiness in this. Dr.
Priestley&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;The greatest happiness of the greatest
number,&rdquo; is pronounced by Jeremy Bentham, one of the most eminent
of ethical writers, &ldquo;a true standard for whatever is right or
wrong, useful, useless, or mischievous in human conduct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>More and more, as men become civilized and enlightened, the egoistic
principles of religionists give way to the altruistic principle of
Rationalists. &ldquo;Live for others&rdquo; is the sublime <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb331" href="#pb331" name=
"pb331">331</a>]</span>teaching of the Positivist Comte. In obeying
this noble precept we are not sacrificing, but augmenting our own
happiness. &ldquo;To do good is my religion,&rdquo; said Thomas Paine.
The rewards and punishments of this religion, which is here but another
name for morality, are happily expressed by Abraham Lincoln:
&ldquo;When I do good I feel good, and when I do bad I feel bad.&rdquo;
The husband and wife who labor for each other&rsquo;s happiness,
regardless of their own; the father and mother who deprive themselves
to make their children happy; men, like Sir Moses Montefiore and Baron
Hirsch, and women, like Florence Nightingale and Clara Barton, who
devote their time and wealth to aid in removing the poverty and
alleviating the sufferings of humanity&mdash;these, by increasing the
happiness of others, increase their own.</p>
<p>When the true principles of morality are universally understood and
accepted, divine revelations will be cast aside and supernatural
religions will die; the zealot&rsquo;s visions of a celestial paradise
will vanish, and the philanthropist&rsquo;s dream of a heaven on earth
will be realized.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="div2 section"><span class="pagenum">[<a href=
"#toc">Contents</a>]</span>
<div class="divHead">
<h3 class="main">Bible Codes.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The Ten Commandments in the Old Testament and the
Sermon on the Mount, including the Golden Rule, in the New, are
supposed to comprise the best moral teachings of the Bible. They are
declared to be so far superior to all other moral codes as to preclude
the idea of human origin. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb332" href=
"#pb332" name="pb332">332</a>]</span></p>
<p>The Decalogue is a very imperfect moral code; not at all superior to
the religious and legislative codes of other ancient peoples. The last
six of these commandments, while not above criticism, are in the main
just, and were recognized alike by Jew and Gentile. They are a crude
attempt to formulate the crystallized experiences of mankind. The first
four (first three according to Catholic and Lutheran versions) possess
no moral value whatever. They are simply religious emanations from the
corrupt and disordered brain of priestcraft. They only serve to obscure
the principles of true morality and produce an artificial system which
bears the same relation to natural morality that a measure of chaff and
grain does to a measure of winnowed grain.</p>
<p>As a literary composition and as a partial exposition of the
peculiar tenets of a heretical Jewish sect, the Sermon on the Mount is
interesting; but as a moral code it is of little value. Along with some
admirable precepts, it contains others, like the following, which are
false and pernicious: &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit;&rdquo;
&ldquo;Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth;&rdquo;
&ldquo;If thy right eye offend thee pluck it out;&rdquo; &ldquo;If thy
right hand offend thee cut it off;&rdquo; &ldquo;Whosoever shall marry
her that is divorced committeth adultery;&rdquo; &ldquo;Resist not
evil;&rdquo; &ldquo;Whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek, turn
to him the other also;&rdquo; &ldquo;If any man will sue thee at the
law, and take away thy coat, let him have <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb333" href="#pb333" name="pb333">333</a>]</span>thy cloak
also;&rdquo; &ldquo;Love your enemies;&rdquo; &ldquo;Lay not up for
yourselves treasures upon earth;&rdquo; &ldquo;Take no thought for your
life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body,
what ye shall put on;&rdquo; &ldquo;Take therefore no thought for the
morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christians claim that unbelievers have no moral standard, that they
alone have such a standard&mdash;an infallible standard&mdash;the
Bible. If we ask them to name the best precept in this standard they
cite the Golden Rule. And yet the Golden Rule is in its very nature
purely a human rule of conduct. &ldquo;Whatsoever ye [men, not God]
would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them.&rdquo; This
rule enjoins what Christians profess to condemn, that every person
shall form his own moral standard. In this rule the so-called divine
laws are totally ignored.</p>
<p>The Golden Rule, so far as the Bible is concerned, is a borrowed
gem. Chinese, Greek, and Roman sages had preached and practiced it
centuries before the Sermon on the Mount was delivered. This rule, one
of the best formulated by the ancients, is not, however, a perfect rule
of human conduct. It does not demand that our desires shall always be
just. But it does recognize and enjoin the principle of reciprocity,
and is immeasurably superior to the rule usually practised by the
professed followers of Jesus: Whatsoever we would that you should do
unto us, do it; and whatsoever we wish to do unto you, that will we do.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb334" href="#pb334" name=
"pb334">334</a>]</span></p>
<p>The three Christian virtues, faith, hope, and charity, fairly
represent this whole system of so-called Bible morals&mdash;two false
or useless precepts to one good precept. Charity is a true virtue, but
&ldquo;faith and hope,&rdquo; to quote Volney, &ldquo;may be called the
virtues of dupes for the benefit of knaves.&rdquo; And if the knaves
have admitted charity to be the greatest of these virtues, it is
because they are the recipients and not the dispensers of it.</p>

<h3 class="main">Bible Models.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">The noblest types of manhood, like Bruno, Spinoza,
Paine, and Ingersoll, have been slandered, anathematized, and slain by
Christians, while the gods, the heroes, the patriarchs, the prophets,
and the priests of the Bible have been presented as the highest models
of moral excellence. Of these, Jehovah, Abraham, Jacob, Moses, David,
Paul, and Christ are represented as the greatest and the best.</p>
<p>Who was Jehovah? &ldquo;A being of terrific character&mdash;cruel,
vindictive, capricious, and unjust.&rdquo;&mdash;Jefferson.</p>
<p>Who was Abraham? An insane barbarian patriarch who married his
sister, denied his wife, and seduced her handmaid; who drove one child
into the desert to starve, and made preparations to butcher the
other.</p>
<p>Who was Jacob? Another patriarch, who won God&rsquo;s love by
deceiving his father, cheating his uncle, robbing his brother,
practicing <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb335" href="#pb335" name=
"pb335">335</a>]</span>bigamy with two of his cousins, and committing
fornication with two of his housemaids.</p>
<p>Who was Moses? A model of meekness; a man who boasted of his own
humility; a man who murdered an Egyptian and hid his body in the sand;
a man who exterminated whole nations to secure the spoils of war, a man
who butchered in cold blood thousands of captive widows, a man who tore
dimpled babes from the breasts of dying mothers and put them to a cruel
death; a man who made orphans of thirty-two thousand innocent girls,
and turned sixteen thousand of them over to the brutal lusts of a
savage soldiery.</p>
<p>Who was David? &ldquo;A man after God&rsquo;s own heart.&rdquo; A
vulgar braggadocio, using language to a woman the mere quoting of which
would send me to prison; a traitor, desiring to lead an enemy&rsquo;s
troops against his own countrymen; a thief and robber, plundering and
devastating the country on every side; a liar, uttering wholesale
falsehoods to screen himself from justice; a red-handed butcher,
torturing and slaughtering thousands of men, women, and children,
making them pass through burning brick-kilns, carving them up with saws
and axes, and tearing them in pieces under harrows of iron; a
polygamist, with a harem of wives and concubines; a drunken debauchee,
dancing half-naked before the maids of his household; a lecherous old
libertine, abducting and ravishing the wife of a faithful soldier; a
murderer, having <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb336" href="#pb336"
name="pb336">336</a>]</span>this faithful soldier put to death after
desolating his home; a hoary-headed fiend, foaming with vengeance on
his dying bed, demanding with his latest breath the deaths of two aged
men, one of whom had most contributed to make his kingdom what it was,
the other a man to whom he had promised protection.</p>

<h3 class="main">Immoral Teachings of the Bible.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">In the modern and stricter sense of the term, morality
is scarcely taught in the Bible. Neither <i>moral</i>, <i>morals</i>,
and <i>morality</i>, nor their equivalents, <i>ethical</i> and
<i>ethics</i>, are to be found in the book. T. B. Wakeman, president of
the Liberal University of Oregon, a life-long student of sociology and
ethics, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word &lsquo;moral&rsquo; does not occur in the Bible, nor
even the idea. Hunting for morals in <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb337" href="#pb337" name="pb337">337</a>]</span>the Bible is like
trying to find human remains in the oldest geologic strata&mdash;in the
eozoon, for instance. Morals had not then been born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I refuse to accept the Bible as a moral guide because it sanctions
nearly every vice and crime. Here is the long list of wrongs which it
authorizes and defends:</p>
<table class="splitlisttable">

<p>The Bible is, for the most part, the crude literature of a people
who lived 2,000 years, and more, ago. Certain principles of right and
wrong they recognized, but the finer principles of morality
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb338" href="#pb338" name=
"pb338">338</a>]</span>were unknown to them. They were an ignorant
people. An ignorant people is generally a religious people, and a
religious people nearly always an immoral people. They believed that
they were God&rsquo;s chosen people&mdash;God&rsquo;s peculiar
favorites&mdash;and that because of this they had the right to rob and
cheat, to murder and enslave the rest of mankind. From these two
causes, chiefly, ignorance and religion, <i>i. e.</i>, superstition,
emanated the immoral deeds and opinions which found expression in the
writings of their priests and prophets.</p>
<p>The passages in the Bible which deal with vice and crime may be
divided into three classes:</p>
<p>1. There are passages which condemn vice and crime. These I
indorse.</p>
<p>2. There are many passages in which the crimes and vices of the
people are narrated merely as historical facts without either
sanctioning or condemning them. The book merits no censure because of
these.</p>
<p>3. There are numerous passages which sanction vice and crime. These,
and these alone, in the chapters which follow, I shall adduce to prove
the charges that I make against the Bible as a moral guide.

<p>Speaking of the Hebrews and Bible writers prior to the Exile and the
introduction of Persian ethics, Dr. Briggs says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They seem to know nothing of the sin of speaking lies as
such. What is the evidence from this silence? They were altogether
unconscious <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb342" href="#pb342" name=
"pb342">342</a>]</span>of its sinfulness. The holiest men did not
hesitate to lie, whenever they had a good object in view, and they
showed no consciousness of sin in it. And the writers who tell of their
lies are as innocent as they.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Decalogue itself does not forbid lying. It forbids perjury; but
mere lying is not forbidden.</p>
<p>Christ taught in parables that he might deceive the people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said unto them, Unto you it is given to know the
mystery of the kingdom of God, but unto them that are without, all
these things are done in parables: That seeing they may see, and not
perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest at any
time they should be converted, and their sins should be forgiven
them&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

<p>The primitive Christians, accepting the Bible as infallible
authority, naturally regarded lying for God&rsquo;s glory not a vice
but a virtue. Mosheim in his &ldquo;Ecclesiastical History&rdquo; says:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb343" href="#pb343" name=
"pb343">343</a>]</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;It was an established maxim with many Christians, that it was
pardonable in an advocate for religion to avail himself of fraud and
deception, if it were likely they might conduce toward the attainment
of any considerable good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dean Milman, in his &ldquo;History of Christianity,&rdquo; says:
&ldquo;It was admitted and avowed that to deceive into Christianity was
so valuable a service as to hallow deceit itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lardner says: &ldquo;Christians of all sorts were guilty of this
fraud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Fell writes: &ldquo;In the first ages of the church, so
extensive was the license of forging, so credulous were the people in
believing that the evidence of transactions was grievously
obscured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>M. Daill&eacute;, one of the most distinguished of French
Protestants, says: &ldquo;For a good end they made no scruple to forge
whole books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Gieseler says they &ldquo;quieted their conscience respecting
the forgery with the idea of their good intention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Priestley says they &ldquo;thought it innocent and commendable
to lie for the sake of truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scaliger says: &ldquo;They distrusted the success of Christ&rsquo;s
kingdom without the aid of lying.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That these admissions are true, that primitive Christianity was
propagated chiefly by falsehood, is tacitly admitted by all Christians.
They characterize as forgeries, or unworthy of credit, three-fourths of
the early Christian writings. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb344"
href="#pb344" name="pb344">344</a>]</span></p>
<p>The thirty-second chapter of the Twelfth Book of Eusebius&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Evangelical Preparation&rdquo; bears this significant title:
&ldquo;How far it may be proper to use falsehood as a medicine, and for
the benefit of those who require to be deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bishop Heliodorus affirms that a &ldquo;falsehood is a good thing
when it aids the speaker and does no harm to the hearers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Synesius, another early Christian bishop, writes: &ldquo;The people
are desirous of being deceived; we cannot act otherwise with
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is what most modern theologians think. With Dr. Thomas Burnett,
they believe that &ldquo;Too much light is hurtful to weak
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the methods employed in establishing the church are still used
in perpetuating its power, a glance at the so-called Christian
literature of the day will suffice to show. Read the works of our
sectarian publishers, examine the volumes that compose our
Sunday-school libraries, peruse our religious papers and periodicals,
and you will see that age has but confirmed this habit formed in
infancy.</p>
<p>Every church dogma is a lie; and based upon lies, the church depends
upon fraud for its support. The work of its ministers is not to
discover and promulgate truths, but to invent and disseminate
falsehoods. In the words of Isaiah, they well might say: &ldquo;We have
made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The church offers a premium on falsehood <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb345" href="#pb345" name="pb345">345</a>]</span>and
imposes a punishment for truthfulness. With a bribe in one hand and a
club in the other, she has sought to prolong her sway. The allurements
of the one and the fear of the other have filled the world with
hypocrisy. In our halls of Congress, in the editorial sanctum, in the
professor&rsquo;s chair, behind the counter, in the workshop, at the
fireside, everywhere, we find men professing to believe what they know
to be false, or wearing the seal of silence on their lips, while rank
imposture stalks abroad and truth is trampled in the mire before
them.</p>
<p>Every truth seeker is taunted and ridiculed; every truth teller
persecuted and defamed; the scientist and philosopher are discouraged
and opposed; the heretic and Infidel calumniated and maligned. In proof
of this, witness the abuse heaped upon the Darwins and Huxleys, see the
countless calumnies circulated against the Paines and Ingersolls.</p>
<p>It is said that Paulus Jovius kept a bank of lies. To those who paid
him liberally he gave noble pedigrees and reputations; those who did
not he slandered and maligned. Paulus is dead, but the church, guided
by Bible morality, continues his business.</p>

<p>Here obtaining goods under false pretenses and embezzlement are
commended by God himself. It may be claimed that the Egyptians had

<p>&ldquo;Anything that dieth of itself&rdquo; is diseased. Diseased
flesh is poisonous. To authorize its use, even if those receiving it
are not deceived, is immoral.</p>
<p>Out West, a family, good Christians, had a hog to die of some
disease. What did they do with it? Eat it? No, their Bible told them
this would be wrong. They dressed it nicely, took it into an adjoining
neighborhood, and sold it to strangers. Was this right? The Bible says
it was.</p>

is said to have planned them and shared in the spoils. He instructs
Moses to send a marauding expedition against the Midianites. They put
the inhabitants to the sword, and return with 800,000 cattle. Of this
booty God exacts 800 head for himself and 8,000 head for his priests.
The remainder he causes to be divided between the soldiers and

<p>Jehu murders all the house of Ahab, and God rewards him for it:</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Joram turned his hands and fled, and said to Ahaziah,
There is treachery, O Ahaziah. And Jehu drew a bow with his full
strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at
his heart and he sunk down in his chariot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when Ahaziah, the king of Judah, saw this, he fled by the
way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite
him also in the chariot. And they did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it, and
she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.
And as Jehu entered in at the gate she said, Had Zimri peace who slew
his master? And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is
on my side? Who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs. And
he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down, and some of her blood
was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses; and he trode her under
foot. And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and <span class=

her; for she is a king&rsquo;s daughter. And they went to bury her, but
they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms
of her hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dogs had devoured her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters
and sent to Samaria&#8202;&hellip;. And it came to pass when the letter
came to them, that they took the king&rsquo;s sons, and slew seventy
persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to
Jezreel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in
Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinsfolks, and his priests,
until he left him none remaining.&rdquo;</p>

and when alone Ehud drew a large dagger from beneath his cloak and

<p>The warmest eulogy in the Bible is bestowed upon a murderess. Sisera
is a fugitive from battle. He reaches in safety the tent of Heber, his
friend. Heber is absent, but Jael, his wife, receives the fugitive, and
bids him welcome. She gives him food, spreads a soft couch for him, and
covers him with her mantle. Wearied with his retreat, and unconscious
of impending danger, Sisera soon sinks into a profound slumber. With a
tent nail in one hand and a hammer in the other, Jael approaches the
bedside of her sleeping guest. She bends over him, listens to assure
herself that he is asleep, then places the nail against his temple, and
with a blow drives it through his head. A struggle, and Sisera is dead,
a victim of one of the most damnable deeds ever committed.</p>
<p>In honor of this assassination, God&rsquo;s favorite prophetess,
Deborah, sings:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed above women shall Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite,
be; blessed shall she be above women in the tent. He asked water, and
she gave him milk; she brought forth butter in a lordly dish. She put
her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the workman&rsquo;s hammer;
and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she smote off his head, when she
had pierced and stricken through his temples. At her feet he bowed, he
fell, he lay down; at her feet he bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there
he fell down dead. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb355" href="#pb355"

window, and cried through the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in
coming? Why tarry the wheels of his chariot?&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>We wish to place before our children, for their emulation, good and
noble characters. We have been taught that in the Bible such characters
may be found. You desire a model woman to place before your daughter.
What one will you select? Here is a woman whom the Bible pronounces
&ldquo;blessed above women.&rdquo; This must be a suitable model, then.
Blessed for what? For committing one of the most infamous of
murders.</p>
<p>We had a Kansas girl who followed in the footsteps of this
&ldquo;blessed woman.&rdquo; Years ago, across the prairies of southern
Kansas stretched a lonely road. By its side, far from other
habitations, stood an unpretentious dwelling, inhabited by four
persons&mdash;father, mother, son, and daughter. But the daughter was
the ruling spirit there. Their only volume, we are told, was a Bible,
and this the daughter read. The house contains two rooms besides the
cellar. The rooms are separated simply by a curtain. In the front room
is kept a small stock of groceries. Here, too, with its back against
the curtain, and fastened to the floor, stands a chair. Above the door
is a sign with this inviting word, &ldquo;Provisions.&rdquo; A traveler
enters and makes some purchases, displaying a well-filled purse. He is
treated hospitably, and invited to <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb356"
href="#pb356" name="pb356">356</a>]</span>remain awhile and rest.
Wearied, he drops into the chair, his head pressing against the
curtain. Armed with a hammer, this follower of Jael now approaches from
the rear. One well-directed blow, and the tired traveler sinks into
eternal rest. His pockets are rifled, and his body thrown into the
cellar, to be taken out at night and buried in the little garden behind
the dwelling. Time rolls on; the traveler does not return. Day after
day his wife at home, with anxious heart, peers through the window and
sighs, &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t he come?&rdquo; At length suspicion rests
upon this den of infamy. A search is instituted, and the garden is
found to be a cemetery, filled with the bodies of murdered
travelers&mdash;one a little child. In the mean time this female
monster with her kin has fled. Detectives are still searching for her.
They&rsquo;ll never find her. Where is she? In heaven with Jael. Now
let some modern Deborah sing, &ldquo;Blessed above maidens shall Kate
Bender be!&rdquo;</p>

thousand wars and little will remain. From the time that Constantine
inscribed the emblem of the cross upon his banner to the present hour,
the church of Christ has been upheld by the sword. Five million troops
maintain its political supremacy in Europe to-day. To &ldquo;express

authority in civil government; of the Lord Jesus Christ as the ruler of
nations, and of his revealed will as of supreme authority;&rdquo; in

that consumed us and devised against us&#8202;&hellip;. Let seven men
of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the
Lord&#8202;&hellip;. And the king said, I will give them. And he
delivered them unto the hands of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them
in the hill before the Lord; and they fell all seven together, and were
put to death in the days of the harvest&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>The sacrifice, we are told, was accepted, and the famine ceased.</p>
<p>Five of these innocent victims, if the Bible be true, were the sons
of Michal, David&rsquo;s own wife. Two were the sons of Rizpah.
Throughout that long summer&mdash;from April till October&mdash;in the
heat and glare of the day and the chill and darkness of the night,
Rizpah, broken-hearted, tenderly watches and protects the decaying
bodies of her dead sons and relatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth, and spread it
for her upon the rock, from the beginning of harvest until water
dropped upon them out of heaven, and suffered neither the birds of the
air to rest on them by day, nor the beasts of the field by
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I dwell on this dark tragedy, and contrast the love and
devotion of this agonized and despairing Hebrew mother with the
malignant <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb363" href="#pb363" name=

and his despicable agent, humanity rises to the highest heaven and
divinity sinks to the lowest hell.</p>
<p>The pathetic story of Jephthah&rsquo;s daughter is familiar to all.
Jephthah is a warrior, and makes a vow that if he is permitted to
conquer the children of Ammon, upon his return the first that meets him
at the door will be offered up for a burnt offering unto the Lord. He
is successful; the Lord permits him to defeat the children of Ammon.
Upon his return the first to meet him is his daughter, an only child.
He tells her of his vow. She prays for two brief months to live. Her
prayer is granted, and at the expiration of this time, the Bible tells
us that Jephthah &ldquo;did with her according to the vow which he had
vowed&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Jud%2011:26-40&amp;version=NRSV">Jud.
xi, 26&ndash;40</a>).</p>
<p>Describing the fulfilment of this terrible vow, Dr. Oort says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This victim, crowned with flowers, was led round the altar
with music and song in honor of Yahweh. She met her cruel fate without
shrinking. But who shall say how sick at heart her father was when he
struck that fatal blow with his own hand and saw the blood of his
darling child poured out upon the sacred stone, while her body was
burned upon the altar?&rdquo; (Bible for Learners, Vol. I., p.
408.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that frightful sacrifice that he performed&mdash;breaking
the holiest domestic ties&mdash;we do but <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb364" href="#pb364" name="pb364">364</a>]</span>see the disastrous
results of a mistaken faith&rdquo; (Ibid., p. 411).</p>
<p>The celebrated Jewish commentator, Dr. Kalisch, while endeavoring to
palliate as far as possible the crimes of his people, admits that human
sacrifices were not uncommon among them:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact stands indisputable that human sacrifices offered to
Jehovah were possible among the Hebrews long after the time of Moses,
without meeting a check or censure from the teachers and leaders of the
nation&rdquo; (Leviticus, Part I., p. 385).</p>
<p>&ldquo;One instance like that of Jephthah not only justifies, but
necessitates, the influence of a general custom. Pious men slaughtered
human victims, not to Moloch, nor to any other foreign deity, but to
the national God, Jehovah&rdquo; (Ibid., p. 390).</p>
<p>Jules Soury says: &ldquo;Nothing is better established than the
existence of human sacrifices among the Hebrews in honor of Iahveh, and
that down to the time of Josiah, perhaps even until the return from the
Babylonish captivity&rdquo; (Religion of Israel, p. 46).</p>
<p>The Church, having received the benefits of a sacrificed God, deems
human sacrifices no longer necessary. But what can be said of the
Church as a whole cannot be said of all its individual members.
Scarcely a year passes without the sacrifice of human beings by those
who believe the Bible to be inspired, and who believe that <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb365" href="#pb365" name="pb365">365</a>]</span>what
was right three thousand years ago is right to-day.</p>
<p>The sacrifice of little Ben Smith at Los Angeles, in 1882, is still
remembered by some. His father was converted at a Methodist revival. He
became very religious. The press dispatches stated that &ldquo;for
several months he devoted his time to the study of the Bible until he
not only convinced himself that he ought to make a human sacrifice, but
brought his wife and their only child, a boy of thirteen, to acquiesce,
in his views.&rdquo; I quote from the mother&rsquo;s testimony:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he talked to me and persuaded me that a good wife ought
to think as her husband did, I got so as to take whatever he said as
the truth. He made us fast, and when Ben asked him if God had ordered
us to starve he said yes. When he announced that the boy must be killed
we both remonstrated, but finally thought it was all right. On the day
appointed for the ceremony he called Ben out of the house and told him
he had to die for our savior. The little fellow knelt down and I got on
my knees by his side; John raised the knife, looked hard into the
boy&rsquo;s face, and then drove the knife into his breast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the mother was overcome with grief. Regaining her composure,
she continued: &ldquo;I am always thinking of Ben; I am always hearing
him in the night asking to be brought in and laid on his bed, and
begging for a little water before he died.&rdquo; <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb366" href="#pb366" name="pb366">366</a>]</span></p>
<p>Let me recall another half-forgotten scene. In a quiet village of
New England live a pair whom nature meant for good, kind citizens. But
they have become infatuated with the Bible. They believe it to be
infallible. Day after day they pore over its pages. They dwell with
especial interest upon the story of Abraham and Isaac, until at last
they become impressed with the belief that they, too, are called upon
to offer up their child. The fatal hour arrives. Nerved for the cruel
deed, they approach the bedside of their child, a sweet-faced,
curly-haired girl of four. How placidly she rests! Folded upon her
breast are dimpled hands, white as the winter snow; curtained in
slumber are eyes as mild as the summer sky. How beautiful! How pure! We
would risk our lives to save that pretty thing from harm. How dear,
then, must she be to that father and that mother! She is their idol.
But that idol is about to be sacrificed upon the altar of superstition.
There they stand&mdash;the mother with a lamp in her hand, the father
with a knife. They gaze for a moment upon their sleeping victim. Then
the father lifts his arm and plunges the knife into the heart of his
child! A quiver&mdash;the blue eyes open, and cast a reproachful look
upon the parent. The little lips exclaim, &ldquo;O papa!&rdquo; and the
sacrifice is made!</p>
<p>You may say these people were insane. Aye, but what made them
insane? And what, more than almost any other cause, is filling our
asylums <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb367" href="#pb367" name=

to reconcile with reason the irreconcilable teachings of the Bible.</p>

<p>The church perpetuates the idea, if not the practice, of
cannibalism. The Christian takes a piece of bread, and tries to make
himself and the world believe that he is eating the body of Christ; he
takes a sup of wine, and says, &ldquo;This is Christ&rsquo;s
blood.&rdquo; Your sacramental feast points to the time when savage
priests gathered around the festal board and supped on human flesh and
blood.</p>
<p>Primitive Christians, many of them, were guilty of cannibalism. In
their Agap&aelig; they <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb369" href=
"#pb369" name="pb369">369</a>]</span>were accustomed to kill and eat an
infant. Dr. Cave in his &ldquo;Primitive Christianity&rdquo; (Part
III., ch. i) says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Epiphanius reports that the Gnostics (a sect of primitive
Christians) at their meetings were wont to take an infant begotten in
their promiscuous mixtures, and, beating it in a mortar, to season it
with honey and pepper and some other spices and perfumes to make it
palatable, and then like swine or dogs to devour it, and then to
conclude all with prayer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meredith, in &ldquo;The Prophet of Nazareth,&rdquo; says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So well known were those horrid vices to be carried on by
Christians in their nocturnal and secret assemblies, and so certain it
was thought that every one who was a Christian participated in them,
that for a person to be known to be a Christian was thought a strong
presumptive proof that he was guilty of these offenses&#8202;&hellip;.
It would appear, however, that, owing to the extreme measures taken
against them by the Romans, both in Italy and in all the provinces, the
Christians, by degrees, were forced to abandon entirely in their
Agap&aelig; infant murders, together with every species of obscenity,
retaining, nevertheless, some of them, such as the kiss of charity, and
the bread and wine, which they contended was transubstantiated into
real flesh and blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the remote districts of Christian Russia, where the rays of our
civilization have not yet <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb370" href=
"#pb370" name="pb370">370</a>]</span>penetrated the darkness of
theology, where Bible morals are still supreme, we are told that even
at the present time a more terribly real form attaches to this
eucharistic ceremony. From Harper&rsquo;s Weekly I quote the
following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hear of horrid sects at present in Russia, practicing
cannibal and human sacrifices with rites almost more devilish than any
recorded in history. &lsquo;The communism of the flesh of the
Lamb&rsquo; and &lsquo;the communism of the blood of the Lamb&rsquo;
really seem to have been invented by the lowest demons of the
bottomless pit. The subject is too revolting to be pursued in detail;
it is enough to say that an infant seven days old is bandaged over the
eyes, stretched over a dish, and a silver spoon thrust into the side so
as to pierce the heart. The elect suck the child&rsquo;s
blood&mdash;that is &lsquo;the blood of the Lamb!&rsquo; The body is
left to dry up in another dish full of sage, then crushed into powder
and eaten&mdash;that is &lsquo;the flesh of the
Lamb!&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The decline in the belief of wizards and witches denotes a decline
of faith in the Bible. Until a very recent period, those who professed
to believe in the divinity of the Bible also professed to believe in
the reality of witchcraft. &ldquo;Giving up witchcraft,&rdquo; says

Sprenger places the total number of executions for witchcraft in Europe
at <i>nine millions</i>. For centuries witch fires burned in nearly
every town of Europe, and this Bible text, &ldquo;Thou shall not suffer

<p>Four hundred were burned at Toulouse in one day. Think of it! Four
hundred women&mdash;guilty of no crime, save that which exists in the
diseased imaginations of their accusers&mdash;four hundred mothers,
wives, and daughters, taken out upon the public square, chained to
posts, the fagots piled around them, and burned to <span class=

flames&mdash;listen to their piteous shrieks&mdash;four hundred voices
raised in one wild chorus of agony! And all because the Bible says,
&ldquo;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Only a few years ago, in the province of Novgorod, Russia, a woman
was burnt for witchcraft. Agrafena was a soldier&rsquo;s widow, and
possessed of more than ordinary gifts of mind. But ignorance and
superstition prevailed around her. Every strange occurrence, every
disease that could not be accounted for, was the result of witchcraft.
One day a farmer&rsquo;s daughter was seized with some violent disease,
and in her paroxysms of pain she chanced to breathe the name of
Agrafena. That was enough; Agrafena was a witch. A mob was raised and
led to the widow&rsquo;s dwelling. They called her to the door,
parleyed with her a moment, then thrust her back into the house,
fastened its doors, and set it on fire. And while it was burning, this
mob, led by Christian priests, stood around it, singing praises to
God&mdash;their strains blended with the shrieks of this dying
woman&mdash;dying because the Bible says, &ldquo;Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in our own America the blighting influence of this delusion and

Pet. ii, 18</a>).</p>
<p>It may be urged that the term &ldquo;servant&rdquo; here refers to a
hired servant. Not so; wherever the word &ldquo;servant&rdquo; occurs
in the New Testament, it means slave in its worst sense.</p>
<p>The Fugitive Slave law, which made us a nation of kidnappers,
derived its authority from the New Testament. Paul had established a
precedent by returning a fugitive slave to his master.</p>
<p>Referring to this act of Paul, the Rev. Dr. Stringfellow of Virginia
wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how immeasurably different Paul&rsquo;s conduct to this
slave and master, from the conduct of our abolition brethren! This is
sufficient to teach any man that slavery is not, in the sight of God,
what it is in the sight of the abolitionists&rdquo; (Scriptural View of
Slavery).</p>
<p>The Rev. Moses Stuart of Massachusetts wrote:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, now, have we here? Paul sending back a Christian
servant, who had run away from his Christian master&#8202;&hellip;.
Paul&rsquo;s conscience sent back the fugitive slave. Paul&rsquo;s
conscience, then, like his doctrines, was very different from that of
the abolitionists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was no easy task to convince the Bible moralist that slavery was
wrong. When the French Revolutionists rejected the Bible, they
abolished slavery in the colonies. When the <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb377" href="#pb377" name=
"pb377">377</a>]</span>church regained control of the government, the
Bible came back, and with it slavery. When Clarkson&rsquo;s bill for
the abolition of slavery was before Parliament, Lord Chancellor Thurlow
characterized it as a &ldquo;miserable and contemptible bill,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;contrary to the Word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charles Bradlaugh, in the North American Review, writing of his own
Christian England, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;George III., a most Christian king, regarded abolition
theories with abhorrence, and the Christian House of Lords was utterly
opposed to granting freedom to the slave. When Christian missionaries,
some sixty years ago, preached to Demerara negroes under the rule of
Christian England, they were treated by Christian judges, holding
commission from Christian England, as criminals for so preaching. A
Christian commissioned officer, member of the Established Church of
England, signed the auction notices for the sale of slaves as late as
1824.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The most zealous defenders of slavery in this country were Bible
moralists. The Rev. Alexander Campbell wrote: &ldquo;There is not one
verse in the Bible inhibiting slavery, but many regulating it. It is
not then, we conclude, immoral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. E. D. Simms, professor in Randolph-Macon College, wrote:
&ldquo;These extracts from Holy Writ unequivocally assert the right of
property in slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. R. Furman, D. D., Baptist, of South Carolina, said:
&ldquo;The right of holding slaves is <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb378" href="#pb378" name="pb378">378</a>]</span>clearly established
in the Holy Scriptures, both by precept and example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. Thomas Witherspoon, Presbyterian, of Alabama, said: &ldquo;I
draw my warrant from the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament to
hold the slave in bondage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the Rev. Mr. Crawder, Methodist, of Virginia: &ldquo;Slavery is
not only countenanced, permitted, and regulated by the Bible, but it
was positively instituted by God himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You say that this is the testimony of interested parties, that the
South was interested in perpetuating slavery. True, but where did your
Northern theologians stand?</p>
<p>Rev. Dr. Wilbur Fisk, President of Wesleyan University, thus wrote:
&ldquo;The New Testament enjoins obedience upon the slave as an
obligation due to a present rightful authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Nathan Lord, President of Dartmouth College, wrote:
&ldquo;Slavery was incorporated into the civil institutions of Moses;
it was recognized accordingly by Christ and his apostles. They
regulated it by the just and benevolent principles of the New
Testament. They condemned all intermeddlers with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Professor Hodge, of Princeton, said: &ldquo;The Savior found it
around him, the Apostles met with it in Asia, Greece, and Italy. How
did they treat it? Not by denunciation of slave-holding as necessarily
sinful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said the Rev. Dr. Taylor, Principal of the Theological Department of
Yale College: &ldquo;I have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb379" href=
"#pb379" name="pb379">379</a>]</span>no doubt that if Jesus Christ were
now on earth, he would, under certain circumstances, become a
slaveholder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is now half-forgotten that the North as well as the South once
practiced slavery&mdash;that New England, New York, New Jersey, and
Pennsylvania all held slaves. Christian New England, which made the
Bible both its legal and moral code, for more than one hundred years,
held Negroes and Indians in slavery, and even sold Quaker children into
bondage. &ldquo;Parish ministers all over New England,&rdquo; says the
Rev. William Goodell, &ldquo;owned slaves&rdquo; (American Slave Code,
p. 106).</p>
<p>Clerical slaveholders in the South trampled under foot the relations
of wife and mother; and clerical slaveholders in the North did the
same. Mr. Goodell says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even in Puritan New England, seventy years ago, female
slaves, in <i>ministers&rsquo;</i> and magistrates&rsquo; families,
bore children, black or yellow, without marriage. No one inquired who
their fathers were, and nothing more was thought of it than of the
breeding of sheep or swine&rdquo; (Ibid., p. 111).</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Congregational minister at Hampton, Conn. (Rev. Mr.
Mosely), separated by sale a husband and wife who were both of them
members of his own church, and who had been, by his own officiating act
as a minister, united in marriage&rdquo; (<span class="corr" id=
"xd26e12075" title="Source: Ib.">Ibid.</span>, p. 114).</p>
<p>Let me cite one of the laws of the Bible relative to the treatment
of slaves&mdash;a law which <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb380" href=
"#pb380" name="pb380">380</a>]</span>demons would blush to indorse, but
which a merciful (?) God enacted for the guidance of his children:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a man smite his servant, or his maid, with a rod, and he
die under his hand, he shall be surely punished. Notwithstanding, if he
continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his
money&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ex%2021:20-21&amp;version=NRSV">Ex.
xxi, 20, 21</a>).</p>
<p>Here a master may brutally beat his slave, and if that slave linger
in the agonies of death a day or two before dying, he shall not be
punished, because the slave &ldquo;is his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Goodell&rsquo;s &ldquo;American Slave Code,&rdquo; a work written by
a Christian clergyman, and which I have already quoted, contains four
hundred pages of outrages, like the following, committed by men who
accepted the Bible as their moral guide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A minister in South Carolina, a native of the North, had a
stated Sabbath appointment to preach, about eight miles from his
residence. He was in the habit of riding thither in his gig. Behind him
ran his negro slave on foot, who was required to be at the place of
appointment as soon as his master, to take care of his horse. Sometimes
he fell behind, and kept his master waiting for him a few minutes, for
which he always received a reprimand, and was sometimes punished. On
one occasion of this kind, after sermon, the master told the slave that
he would take care to have him keep up with him, going home. So he tied
him by the wrists, with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb381" href=
"#pb381" name="pb381">381</a>]</span>a halter, to his gig behind, and
drove rapidly home. The result was that, about two or three miles from
home, the poor fellow&rsquo;s feet and legs failed him, and he was
dragged on the ground all the rest of the way by the wrists! On
alighting and looking round, the master exclaimed, &lsquo;Well; I
thought you would keep up with me this time!&rsquo; So saying, he
coolly walked into the house. The servants came out and took up the
poor sufferer for dead. After a time he revived a little, lingered for
a day or two, <i>and died</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was this brutal minister punished? He was not. &ldquo;If he continue
a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.&rdquo; Was
he silenced from preaching? was he even reprimanded by the church? No.
Without punishment, without censure, he continued to preach Bible
morals and abuse his slaves.</p>
<p>Frederick Douglass, the greatest of his race and a slave, says:
&ldquo;My master found religious sanctity for his
cruelty&#8202;&hellip;. I have seen him tie up a lame young woman and
whip her with a heavy cowskin upon her naked shoulders, causing the
warm red blood to drip; and, in justification of the bloody deed, he
would quote this passage of Scripture: &lsquo;He that knoweth his
master&rsquo;s will and doeth it not shall be beaten with many
stripes.&rsquo;&#8202;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Slavery flourished on this continent because the Bible taught that
it was lawful and just. To oppose slavery was to oppose the plainest
teachings of this book. The Abolition movement was <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb382" href="#pb382" name="pb382">382</a>]</span>an
Infidel movement. The Emancipation Proclamation was a nullification of
&ldquo;God&rsquo;s law.&rdquo; The great Rebellion was a contest
between Bible morality and natural morality. The latter triumphed, but
the conflict filled half a million graves, brought grief to many
million hearts, and covered the land with desolation.</p>
<p>And this advocate of slavery is the idol Protestants worship; this
is the book they wish to become the law of our land; this is the moral
guide they wish to place in our public schools! In the name of those
who died for the freedom of their fellow-men; in the name of those made
childless, fatherless, and companionless by this cruel strife; in the
name of those whose backs still bear the scars of the master&rsquo;s
lash; in the name of human liberty, I protest against this
retrogressive movement!</p>

<h3 class="main">Polygamy.</h3>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I refuse to accept the Bible as a moral guide because
it sanctions that other twin relic of barbarism, polygamy.</p>
<p>The Mosaic law provides that &ldquo;if a man have two wives, one
beloved and another hated,&rdquo; he shall not ignore the legal rights
of the hated wife&rsquo;s children (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

the validity of the institution.</p>
<p>Another statute (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=
"Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Dt%2025:5&amp;version=NRSV">Deut.
xxv, 5</a>) provides that if a man die, his surviving brother shall
become the husband of his widow, and this regardless as to whether the
brother be married or single. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb383"
href="#pb383" name="pb383">383</a>]</span></p>
<p>The first eighteen verses of the eighteenth chapter of Leviticus are
devoted to what is termed &ldquo;unlawful marriages.&rdquo; Here
polygamy is recognized and regulated to the extent of prohibiting a man
from marrying the sister of a living wife.</p>
<p>But there is one statute which places the validity of this
institution, so far as the Bible is concerned, beyond all controversy.
Deuteronomy (xxiii, 2) declares that no illegitimate child shall enter
into the congregation of the Lord, even up to the tenth generation.
Now, polygamy was either lawful or unlawful. If unlawful, then the
children of polygamists were illegitimate children, and disqualified
for the sanctuary. But the children of polygamists were not thus
disqualified. The founders of the twelve tribes of Israel were all
children of a polygamist.</p>
<p>The most renowned Bible characters were polygamists. Abraham had two
wives, and when he died the Lord said, &ldquo;Abraham obeyed my voice,
and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws&rdquo;
(<a class="biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible"
href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Gn%2026:6&amp;version=NRSV">Gen.
xxvi, 6</a>).</p>
<p>Jacob was a polygamist, and after he had secured four wives and
concubines, God blessed him and said, &ldquo;Be fruitful and
multiply&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

<p>David had a score of wives and concubines, <span class=

&ldquo;David was a man after God&rsquo;s own heart;&rdquo; &ldquo;David

&ldquo;I delivered thee out of the hands of Saul; and I gave thee thy

Sam. xii, 7, 8</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much,
and largeness of heart&rdquo;&mdash;sufficient to hold a thousand wives
and concubines.</p>
<p>Many years ago the Mormon, Orson Pratt, wrote a defense of polygamy,
based upon the Bible. A noted lawyer of New York sent a copy of it to
the Rev. Dr. W. B. Sprague with the interrogation, &ldquo;Can you
answer this?&rdquo; Back came the frank reply, &ldquo;No; can
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is claimed that the New Testament is opposed to polygamy. It is
not. William Ellery Channing says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no prohibition of polygamy in the New Testament. It
is an indisputable fact that although Christianity was first preached
in Asia, which had been from the earliest ages the seat of polygamy,
the Apostles never denounced it as a crime, and never required their
converts to put away all wives but one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Elizabeth Cady Stanton says: &ldquo;It was at a Jewish polygamous
wedding that Jesus performed his first miracle, and polygamy was
practiced by Christians for centuries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is true that many primitive Christians did not practice polygamy.
And why? Because Pagan Greece and Rome had taught them better.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb385" href="#pb385" name=
"pb385">385</a>]</span>It was to them, and not to their Scriptures,
that they were indebted for the monogamic system of marriage. The Roman
Catholic church did not generally sustain polygamy; but it did sustain
a system of concubinage which was certainly as bad. For centuries the
keeping of concubines was almost universal among the Catholic clergy,
one abbot keeping no less than seventy.</p>
<p>The founders of the Protestant church, however, accepting the Bible
as their guide, attaching to it a degree of authority which had never
been attached to it before, were candid and consistent enough to admit
the validity of the institution. Referring to this subject, Sir William
Hamilton, a Christian and a Protestant, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to polygamy in particular, which not only Luther,
Melanchthon, and Bucer, the three leaders of the German Reformation,
speculatively adopted, but to which above a dozen distinguished divines
among the Reformers stood formally committed&rdquo; (Discussions on
Philosophy and Literature).</p>
<p>Speaking of Luther and Melanchthon, Hamilton says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;They had both promulgated opinions in favor of polygamy, to
the extent of vindicating to the spiritual minister a right of private
dispensation, and to the temporal magistrate the right of establishing
the practice if he chose by public law&rdquo; (Ibid).</p>
<p>In accordance with these views, John of <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb386" href="#pb386" name=
"pb386">386</a>]</span>Leydon, a zealous Protestant, established
polygamy at Munster, and murdered or drove from their homes all who
dared to oppose the odious custom. Other Protestants followed his
example.</p>
<p>On the 19th of December, 1539, at Wittenberg, Luther and Melanchthon
drew up the famous &ldquo;Consilium,&rdquo; authorizing the landgrave,
Philip of Hesse, to have a plurality of wives. This instrument bears
the signatures of Martin Luther, Philip Melanchthon, Martin Bucer,
Dionysius Melander, John Lening, Antony Corvinus, Adam Kraft, Justus
Winther, and Balthasar Raida, nine of the leading Protestant divines of
Germany.</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact that Luther advised Henry VIII. to adopt
polygamy in his case, but by divorcing two wives, and murdering two
more, the founder of the English church avoided it.</p>
<p>The advocacy of polygamy by the chief Reformers prevented Ferdinand
I. from declaring for the Reformation. The German princes, too,
generally opposed it; and this opposition, coupled with the fact that
the most licentious sects espoused it, finally caused a reaction in
favor of monogamy.</p>
<p>Protestants, it ill became you to point the finger of scorn at the
Mormons of Utah. Yet with characteristic consistency you were demanding
the suppression of polygamy in the territories, while at the same time
you were endeavoring <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb387" href="#pb387"
name="pb387">387</a>]</span>to have the whole country accept as
infallible authority a book which sanctions the pernicious custom. Make
the Bible the fundamental law of the land, as you demand, and polygamy
will become, in theory at least, a national instead of a local
institution. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb388" href="#pb388" name=

</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">I refuse to accept the Bible as a moral guide because
it sanctions adultery and prostitution.</p>
<p>Adultery is made prominent by the recital of the numerous adulteries
of Abraham, Lot, Jacob, Judah, Samson, David, and other Bible saints,
and sanctified by the approved adulteries of Abraham and Jacob.</p>
<p>Both Abraham and Isaac were willing to sell the virtue of their
wives to save themselves from harm.</p>
<p>Two instances are recorded of fathers having offered their own
daughters to gratify the lust of a sensual mob, and these abominable
acts are represented as especially meritorious. Read the nineteenth
chapter of Genesis and the nineteenth chapter of Judges; dwell upon the
eighth verse of the former and the twenty-fourth verse of the latter;
and then, if you can indorse the spirit of these narratives, you are
unfit to be the parent of a daughter.</p>
<p>The Mosaic law authorizes a father to sell his daughter for a
concubine or mistress (euphemistically <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb389" href="#pb389" name="pb389">389</a>]</span>translated
&ldquo;maid servant&rdquo;). God&rsquo;s instructions respecting the
thirty-two thousand captive Midianite maidens impliedly sanction
concubinage and prostitution.</p>
<p>These Bible teachings have been the cause of countless outrages
against the chastity of woman. John Wesley says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Almost all the soldiers in the Christian world &hellip; have
claimed, more especially in time of war, another kind of liberty: that
of borrowing the wives and daughters of the men that fell into their
hands&rdquo; (Wesley&rsquo;s Miscellaneous Works, Vol. III., p.
117).</p>
<p>Luther, drawing his morality from the Bible, gave concubinage his
indorsement:</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing unusual in princes keeping concubines; and
although the lower orders may not perceive the excuses of the thing,
the more intelligent know how to make allowance&rdquo;
(Consilium<span class="corr" id="xd26e12226" title=
"Not in source">)</span>.</p>
<p>Luther might with equal truthfulness have said, &ldquo;There is
nothing unusual in priests and preachers keeping concubines,&rdquo; and
he might have helped to confirm it by a few leaves from his own private
history. In a letter to his confidential friend, Spalatin, he confessed
to numerous adulteries.</p>
<p>God instructs his prophet Hosea to marry a prostitute. He
subsequently commands him to love and hire an adulteress (<a class=
"biblink xd26e45" title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=

<p>Christ forgave the woman taken in adultery, <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb390" href="#pb390" name=
"pb390">390</a>]</span>while his favorite female companion was a
reformed (?) prostitute. Referring to his female ancestors, Dr.
Alexander Walker, a Christian, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is remarkable that in the genealogy of Christ only four
women have been named: Tamar, who seduced the father of her late
husband; Rachab, a common prostitute; Ruth, who, instead of marrying
one of her cousins, went to bed with another of them, and Bathsheba, an
adultress, who espoused David, the murderer of her husband&rdquo;
(Woman, p. 330).</p>
<p>The early Christians were notorious for their adulteries. Dr. Cave,
in his &ldquo;Primitive Christianity&rdquo; (Part II., ch. v), says it
was commonly charged &ldquo;that the Christians knew one another by
certain privy marks and signs, and were wont to be in love almost
before they knew one another; that they exercised lust and filthiness
under a pretense of religion, promiscuously calling themselves brothers
and sisters, that by the help of so sacred a name their common
adulteries might become incestuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of the Carpocratians, who Dr. Lardner says &ldquo;are not accused of
rejecting any part of the New Testament,&rdquo; Dr. Cave says:
&ldquo;Both men and women used to meet at supper (which was called
their love-feast), when after they had loaded themselves with a
plentiful meal, to prevent all shame, if they had any remaining, they
put out the lights, and then promiscuously mixed in filthiness with one
another&rdquo; (Ibid). <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb391" href=
"#pb391" name="pb391">391</a>]</span></p>
<p>In his Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul says: &ldquo;It is reported
commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as
is not so much as named among the gentiles&rdquo; (<a class=

<p>It is an indisputable fact that the most notorious adulterers are
those whose profession makes them most familiar with the teachings of
the Bible, and compels them to accept its teachings as divine.</p>

an expurgated edition of the Bible. In vindication of his work, he
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many passages are expressed in language which decency forbids
to be repeated in families and in the pulpit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. Embree, Methodist, of Kansas, in a speech before the
Topeka School Board advocating the reading of Bible selections in the
public schools of that city, recently said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not want the Bible read indiscriminately. I think
some of it unfit to be read by any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Rev. Father Maguire, Catholic, in his debate with the Rev. Mr.
Greg, at Dublin, gave utterance to the following:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg of you not to continue such a practice; it is
disreputable. I will ask Mr. Greg a question (and I beg of you, my
brethren of the Protestant church, to bear this in mind), I will ask
him if he dare to take up the Bible and read from the book of Genesis
the fact of Onan&mdash;I ask him will he read that? Will he read the
fact relative to Lot and his two daughters? Will he read these and many
other passages which I could point out to him in the Holy Bible, which
I would not take one thousand guineas, nay, all the money in the world,
and read them here to-day?&rdquo;</p>

<p>God&rsquo;s especial favorites had a weakness for wine. When he
drowned the world&rsquo;s inhabitants he saved Noah, knowing that as
soon as the waters subsided he would plant a vineyard, make wine, and
become intoxicated. When Sodom was destroyed the only righteous man he
found was that foul drunkard, Lot. When David made his celebrated feast
in honor of the Lord he gave to every man and woman a flagon of wine.
He kept some for himself and so merry did his heart become that he
&ldquo;danced before the Lord with all his might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus joyously sings Solomon: &ldquo;I have drunk my wine with my
milk [milk punch]; eat, O friends! drink, yea, drink abundantly.&rdquo;
In the morning he sings another song: &ldquo;Open to me &hellip; my
love &hellip; for my head is filled with dew.&rdquo; How many a wayward
fellow like Solomon has risen from the gutter, sorrowfully wended his
way home, and serenaded his sleeping spouse with that same melody!</p>
<p>When Solomon erected his temple to God he gave to his laborers
&ldquo;twenty thousand baths [nearly 175,000 gallons] of wine&rdquo;

<p>God commanded Jeremiah to tempt with wine those who abstained from

<p>&ldquo;Go unto the house of the Rechabites and speak with them, and

give them wine to drink&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45" title=

<p>This censure was evidently not unmerited. The first act in
Christ&rsquo;s ministerial career was to manufacture three barrels of
wine for a wedding feast; his last recorded act was a benediction upon
the wine cup.</p>
<p>Theology being no longer in demand, the Protestant clergy, contrary
to the teachings of the Bible, and the traditions of the church, now
find it popular and profitable to espouse the cause of temperance. But
in championing one rational virtue they employ two Christian vices,
hypocrisy and intolerance. The most inconsistent, the most uncharitable
opponents of the liquor traffic to-day are these fresh converts who
profess to be doing their master&rsquo;s will and who claim that his
Word is the advocate of total abstinence and prohibitory laws. With
fierce invective they declaim against the old God Bacchus, yet every
anathema they hurl at <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb398" href=
"#pb398" name="pb398">398</a>]</span>him will apply with equal justice
to their God and Christ.</p>
<p>One of the most unscrupulous arguments ever adduced in support of
any cause is that now advanced by some Christian temperance advocates
to the effect that the wine sanctioned in the Bible was not
intoxicating. With the same ease that they declare that in the Bible
&ldquo;black&rdquo; means &ldquo;white,&rdquo; that &ldquo;hate&rdquo;
means &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and &ldquo;day&rdquo; means
&ldquo;age,&rdquo; they declare that Bible wine does not mean wine, but
unfermented grape juice.</p>
<p>The Rev. Dr. W. M. Thompson, Rev. William Wright, Rev. S. H.
Calhoun, Rev. C. V. A. Van Dyke, and other able Hebrew and Sanscrit
scholars of Western Asia, who have made the history and customs of its
people both ancient and modern a life study, affirm that such a thing
as non-intoxicating wine was unknown, that the unfermented juice of the
grape was never recognized as wine. Dr. Philip Schaff, the foremost
Bible scholar of this country, affirms the same:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wine of the Bible was no doubt pure and
unadulterated&#8202;&hellip;. It was genuine and real wine, and, like
all wine in use in grape-growing countries, exhilarating. To lay down
the principle that the use of intoxicating drink as a beverage is a
sin&mdash;<i>per se</i>&mdash;is to condemn the greater part of
Christendom, to contradict the Bible, and to impeach Christ himself,
who drank wine and made wine by miracle to supply the marriage
guests.&rdquo; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb399" href="#pb399" name=
"pb399">399</a>]</span></p>
<p>At the General Assembly of the Presbyterian church held at Belfast,
Ireland, in 1870, an exhaustive examination and discussion was given
this subject. The result was the adoption by an almost unanimous vote
of the following resolution offered by the Rev. Robert Wales, Professor
of Dialectic Theology, Belfast:</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the wine used in the oblations of the Old Testament time
at the Passover and by our Lord Jesus Christ himself in the institution
of the supper was the ordinary wine of the country, that is, the
fermented juice of the grape, we cannot sanction the use of the
unfermented juice of the grape as a symbol in the ordinance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That the sacramental wine used by the early Christians was
intoxicating, and that they were addicted to using it to excess at the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, is admitted by Paul (<a class="biblink xd26e45"
title="Link to cited location in Bible" href=
"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Cor%2011:20-34&amp;version=NRSV">1
Cor. xi, 20&ndash;34</a>).</p>
<p>Referring to this subject, the Christian Register says: &ldquo;We
deplore intemperance, and welcome every truthful argument against it,
but the argument founded on the non-intoxicating character of Bible
wine is a weak and diluted fallacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Kidnapping is commanded for the purpose of obtaining wives.</p>

the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives according to their

<p>The Levitical law makes motherhood a sin that can be expiated only
by offering a sin offering at the birth of every child. The degree of
sinfulness depends upon the sex of the child; giving birth to a

<p>The teachings of the Bible have been used by the church to keep
woman in a subordinate position.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is not a more cruel chapter in history,&rdquo; says Dr.
Moncure D. Conway, &ldquo;than that which records the arrest by
Christianity of the natural growth of European civilization regarding
woman. In Germany it found woman participating <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb408" href="#pb408" name="pb408">408</a>]</span>in
the legislative assembly, and sharing the interests and counsels of
man, and drove her out and away&#8202;&hellip;. Even more fatal was the
overthrow of woman&rsquo;s position in Rome. Read the terrible facts as
stated by Gibbon, by Milman, and Sir Henry Maine; read and ponder them,
and you will see the tremendous wrong that Christianity did to
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even the priceless virtue of chastity, in the name of law and in the
name of the Bible, was trampled under foot. Mrs. Gage, in &ldquo;Woman,
Church, and State,&rdquo; says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women were taught by the church and state alike that the
feudal lord, or seigneur, had a right to them, not only against
themselves, but as against any claim of husband or father. The law
known as <i>Marchetta</i>, or Marquette, compelled newly-married women
to a most dishonorable servitude. They were regarded as the rightful
prey of the feudal lord from one to three days after their
marriage&#8202;&hellip;. France, Germany, Prussia, England, Scotland,
and all Christian countries where feudalism existed, held to the
enforcement of Marquette.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Respecting this law, Michelet writes: &ldquo;The lords spiritual had
this right no less than the lords temporal. The parson, being a lord,
expressly claimed the first fruits of the bride&rdquo; (La Sorcerie,
page 62).</p>
<p>In this country, while the most illiterate and depraved man is
clothed with the rights of a <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb409" href=
"#pb409" name="pb409">409</a>]</span>sovereign, the noblest woman is
held in a subordinate position; and from the Bible, priests and
politicians have procured the chains that hold her in subjection.</p>
<p>Referring to the Bible, America&rsquo;s greatest woman, Elizabeth
Cady Stanton, says: &ldquo;I know of no other books that so fully teach
the subjection and degradation of woman&rdquo; (Eighty Years and
More).</p>
<p>Brave Helen Gardener says: &ldquo;Every injustice that has ever been
fastened upon women in a Christian country has been &lsquo;authorized
by the Bible&rsquo; and riveted and perpetuated by the pulpit&rdquo;
(Men, Women, and Gods, page 14).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Women are indebted to-day for their emancipation from a
position of hopeless degradation, not to their religion nor to Jehovah,
but to the justice and honor of the men who have defied his
commandments. That she does not crouch to-day where St. Paul tried to
bind her, she owes to the men who are grand and brave enough to ignore
St. Paul, and rise superior to his God&rdquo; (Ibid, page 30).</p>
<p>George W. Foote of England says it will yet be the proud boast of
woman that she never contributed a line to the Bible.</p>

<p>Portions of the Old Testament, and particularly those relating to
sacrifices, are calculated to foster a spirit of brutality, and a total
disregard for animal life. God revels in the blood of the innocent. The
offering of fruits made by Cain is rejected by him; the bloody
sacrifice of Abel is accepted.</p>
<p>Nearly the entire book of Leviticus is devoted to such laws as
these:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
before the Lord. And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his
offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation; and
Aaron&rsquo;s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon

his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be
wrung out at the side of the altar&rdquo; (<a class="biblink xd26e45"

<p>The minutest directions for conducting these bloody sacrifices come
from the lips of Jehovah himself, and are too brutal and disgusting to
repeat.</p>
<p>The number of animals sacrificed was incredible. At times whole
herds were killed. On one occasion Asa sacrificed 700 oxen and 7,000
sheep. David made an offering of 1,000 bullocks and 2,000 sheep. At the
dedication of the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb413" href="#pb413"

sacrificed by Solomon.</p>

<p>A God of mercy, it would seem, ought to protect the weaker orders of
his creation; but the God of the Bible manifests an utter disregard for
them. When the being created in his own image proved too true a copy,
and he wished to destroy it, he sent a deluge, &ldquo;and all flesh
died that moved upon the earth.&rdquo; To wreak his vengeance upon
Pharaoh, he visited with disease and death his unoffending cattle. In
times of war, he ordered his followers to &ldquo;slay both man and
beast.&rdquo; Saul&rsquo;s great transgression, the chief cause of his
dethronement and death, was that he saved alive some sheep and oxen
instead of killing them as God desired. David and Joshua, God&rsquo;s
favorite warriors, houghed the horses of their enemies, and thus
disabled turned them loose to die.</p>
<p>We teach a child that it is wrong to rob the nests of birds. It
opens the Bible and reads:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If a bird&rsquo;s nest chance to be before thee in the way in
any tree, or on the ground, whether <span class="pagenum">[<a id=

<p>Throughout Christendom &ldquo;man&rsquo;s inhumanity to man&rdquo;
is only equaled by his cruelty to the inferior animals. The Buddhist,
who has not the Bible for his guide, considers it a sin to harm the
meanest creature. Even the savage kills only what he needs for food, or
such as threaten him with danger. But the Christian, whose Bible gives
him dominion over the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air,
maims and murders in pure wantonness, and after years of patient
service, even turns his beast of burden out to die of hunger and
neglect.</p>
<p>For the sake of these dumb creatures, would that our world had less
theology, and more humanity; had fewer Moodys, and more Henry Berghs!

firm for the government, and on that account persecuted by the

<p>&ldquo;I know not what the private opinions of those sturdy patriots
were, who, in the old Philadelphia State House, appended their

<p>From the first century to the twentieth&mdash;from Paul to
Leo&mdash;these Bible teachings have dominated the Christian world. Of
the early Christian Fathers, Lecky writes:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The teaching of the early Fathers on the subject is perfectly
unanimous and unequivocal. Without a single exception, all who touched
upon the subject pronounced active resistance to the established
authorities to be under all circumstances sinful&rdquo; (Rationalism in
Europe, Vol. II., page 136).</p>
<p>Jeremy Taylor, one of the greatest of modern divines, speaking not
for himself alone, but for all Christians, says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter of Scripture being so plain that it needs no
interpretation, the practice and doctrine of the church, which is
usually the best commentary, is now but of little use in a case so
plain; yet this also is as plain in itself, and without any variety,
dissent, or interruption universally agreed upon, universally practiced
and taught, that, let the powers set over us be what they will, we must
suffer it and never right ourselves&rdquo; (Ductor Dubitantium, Book
III., chapter iii).</p>
<p>This has been the chief cause of Christian triumph and Christian
supremacy. It has secured for the church the adherence and support of
every tyrant in Christendom. Thomas Jefferson truly says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In every country and in every age the priest has been hostile
to liberty; he is always in alliance <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb418" href="#pb418" name="pb418">418</a>]</span>with the despot,
abetting his abuses in return for protection to his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Writing of his country and his country&rsquo;s church, Macaulay
says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Church of England continued to be for more than 150 years
the servile handmaid of monarchy, the steady enemy of public liberty.
The divine right of kings and the duty of passively obeying all their
commands were her favorite tenets. She held these tenets firmly through
times of oppression, persecution, and licentiousness, while law was
trampled down, while judgment was perverted, while the people were
eaten as though they were bread&rdquo; (Essays, Vol. I., page 60).</p>

them flayed alive&mdash;their bleeding bodies seared with red-hot
irons; we see them covered with pitch and oil and set on fire; we see
them hurled headlong from towers to the stony streets below; we see

<h2 class="main">CONCLUSION.</h2>
</div>
<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Twenty crimes and vices&mdash;lying, cheating,
stealing, murder, wars of conquest, human sacrifices, cannibalism,
witchcraft, slavery, polygamy, adultery, obscenity, intemperance,
vagrancy ignorance, injustice to woman, unkindness to children, cruelty
to animals, tyranny, persecution&mdash;are, we have seen, sanctioned by
the Bible. Scattering this book broadcast over the land, making it the
chief text-book of the Sunday-school and, above all, placing it in our
public schools and compelling our youth to accept it as infallible
authority, is a monstrous wrong; and you who advocate it are the
enemies of virtue and the promoters of vice. James Anthony Froude says:
&ldquo;Considering all the heresies, the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13102" title="Source: ernormous">enormous</span> crimes, the
wickedness, the astounding follies, which the Bible has been made to
justify, and which its indiscriminate reading has suggested;
considering that it has been, indeed, the sword which our Lord said he
was sending, and that not the devil himself could have invented an
implement more potent to fill the hated world with lies and blood and
fury, I <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb424" href="#pb424" name=
"pb424">424</a>]</span>think certainly that to send hawkers over the
world loaded with copies of this book, scattering it in all places,
among all persons, &hellip; is the most culpable folly of which it is
possible for man to be guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are within the lids of this Bible a hundred chapters
sanctioning the bloodiest deeds in all the annals of crime; and this is
the book you wish to place in the hands of our sons! There are within
the lids of this Bible a hundred chapters which no modest woman can
read without her cheek becoming tinged with the blush of shame; and
this is the book you wish to place in the hands of our daughters! If
you delight to feast upon such carrion you have the right to do so, but
you have no right to thrust it down the throats of your neighbors. As a
Liberal, I concede to the Christian cuckoo the right to propagate her
species; but I protest against her laying her eggs in the secular nest
and having them hatched by the state.</p>
<p>I contend that the Bible does not present an infallible moral
standard, and I have given many valid reasons why it does not. I expect
the defenders of this book to complete the task that I have here
essayed. They will claim that the Bible is opposed to crime. They will,
no doubt, cite numerous passages in confirmation of this claim. Let
them do this. Then place the results of our labors side by side. This
will show that the Bible abounds with teachings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb425" href="#pb425" name="pb425">425</a>]</span>that
conflict. This fact established, the dogma of its divinity must fall.
And this is what I am endeavoring to do&mdash;to tear this dogma from
the human brain. Not until this is done can we have a pure morality. So
long as men&rsquo;s minds are confused and corrupted by these
conflicting and demoralizing teachings, so long will immorality
prevail. You cannot make men moral while they accept as their moral
guide a book which sanctions every crime and presents as the best
models of human excellence the most notorious villains. You cannot make
them moral by teaching them that a lie is better for being called
inspired, that a vice becomes a virtue with age, that a dead rogue
should be canonized and a live one killed.</p>
<p>Not until this dogma is destroyed can you appreciate what is
meritorious in the Bible. There are in it some noble precepts. It
contains along with the false much that is true; along with the bad
much that is good; but while you are compelled to accept all&mdash;the
true and the false, the good and the bad, as alike infallible, as alike
divine&mdash;it can be of no value to you.</p>
<p>You may contend that I mistake the meaning of what I have quoted
from this book. But the language is too plain to be mistaken. Do not
tell me that it states one thing and means another. This is, you
affirm, the word of your God. Is your God wanting in candor?</p>
<p>So far as the Bible is concerned, the criminal has as much to
support the justness of his <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb426" href=
"#pb426" name="pb426">426</a>]</span>crime as the Christian has to
sustain the truthfulness of his creed. The various doctrines of the
church are not upheld by stronger Scripture proofs than have been cited
in justification of the crimes that I have named.</p>
<p>Bible apologists tell us that it is only in this book that
wrongdoers confess and record their sins, and that this is evidence of
its divinity. Were this true we might say that the Bible is the only
book whose authors are so devoid of shame as to parade their sins. But
this claim is not true. It was not the sinners who wrote these accounts
of their sins any more than it is the criminals to-day who write and
publish the accounts of their crimes.</p>
<p>Bible lands, we are told, are more moral than other lands. This is
false. The morality of Pagan China and Japan, without the Bible, is not
inferior to that of Christian Europe with it. Modern Europe with its
partial rejection of the Bible is superior in morality to medieval
Europe with its full acceptance of it. The morals of the people have
improved in about the same ratio that their faith in the book has
declined. A further declension of faith will bring a further
improvement in morals. In Christian countries those who have discarded
its teachings are morally superior to those who still accept them. It
is the ignorant who are the most devout believers in this book, and it
is the ignorant who are the most immoral. The intelligence and morality
to be found in Christian lands are not <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb427" href="#pb427" name="pb427">427</a>]</span>the results of Bible
teachings, but exist in spite of them.</p>
<p>That some great and good men have commended the Bible as a moral
guide is true. These commendations are given wide publicity. But the
testimonials of these men are, for the most part, not the result of
careful reading and study. They have been inspired by the teachings of
childhood, by the sentiment that prevails around them, or by a perusal
of only the choicest portions of the book. These testimonials, too, are
mostly from men who, while expressing admiration for many of its
teachings, do not believe and do not profess to believe in its
divinity. Many of these testimonials are forgeries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you discard the Bible, what,&rdquo; asks the Christian,
&ldquo;will you give us as a moral guide?&rdquo; Enter a public library
blindfolded; take from its shelves a volume at random, and you will
scarcely select a worse one. The book you select may not pertain to
morals. It may not even contain the word &ldquo;moral.&rdquo; But
neither does the Bible. Must we go to the ignorant past for our
morality? Does human experience count for nothing? Have the most
marvelous advances been made in every other department of human
knowledge during the past two thousand years and none in ethical
science? Read Bentham, Mill, and Spencer. Let your children study Count
Volney&rsquo;s &ldquo;Law of Nature,&rdquo; and Miss Wixon&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Right Living.&rdquo; These books are not infallible and divine,
they are fallible and human; <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb428" href=
"#pb428" name="pb428">428</a>]</span>but they are immeasurably superior
to any books that supernaturalists can offer. Not in Moses nor Jesus,
not in the Decalogue nor Sermon on the Mount, is there to be found a
statement of moral duties so just and so comprehensive as the following
from Volney:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>What do you conclude from all this?</i> I conclude from it
that all the social virtues are only the habitude of actions useful to
society and to the individual who practices them; that they all refer
to the physical object of man&rsquo;s preservation; that nature having
implanted in us the want of that preservation, has made a law to us of
all its consequences, and a crime of everything that deviates from it;
that we carry in us the seed of every virtue, and of every perfection;
that it only requires to be developed that we are only happy inasmuch
as we observe the rules established by nature for the end of our
preservation; and that all wisdom, all perfection, all law, all virtue,
all philosophy, consist in the practice of these axioms founded on our
own organization:&mdash;<span class="sc">Preserve thyself; Instruct
thyself; Moderate thyself</span>; live for thy fellow-men, that they
may live for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bible moralist would have us believe that from this book all
morality has been derived; that God is the author and the Bible the
revelation and sole repository of moral laws. But it is not from Gods
and Bibles that these laws have come. In the words of Tyndall,
&ldquo;Not in the way assumed by our dogmatic teachers has the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb429" href="#pb429" name=
"pb429">429</a>]</span>morality of human nature been propped up. The
power that has molded us thus far has worked with stern tools upon a
rigid stuff&#8202;&hellip;. That power did not work with delusions, nor
will it stay its hands when such are removed. Facts, rather than
dogmas, have been its ministers&mdash;hunger, shame, pride, love, hate,
terror, awe&mdash;such were the forces, the interaction and adjustment
of which during the immeasurable ages of his development wove the
triplex web of man&rsquo;s physical, intellectual, and moral nature,
and such are the forces that will be effectual to the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accepting the Bible&mdash;not for what it is claimed to be, the word
of God, but for what it is, the work of man&mdash;I can excuse, in a
degree, the crude ideas of right and wrong and the laxity of morals
that prevailed among the people whose history it purports to record.
The age in which they lived, the circumstances that surrounded them,
must palliate, to some extent, their deeds and theories. But it is
humiliating to think that in these better times, illuminated by the
light of a glorious civilization, there are those who spurn the robes
of virtue that Reason in the loom of grave Experience has woven, and
who from the dark and musty closets of the past drag forth for use the
soiled and blood-stained garments that barbarians wore.</p>
<hr class="tb">
<p>With this chapter our review of the Bible ends. We have examined
successively the authenticity <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb430"
href="#pb430" name="pb430">430</a>]</span>of its books, the credibility
of its statements, and the morality of its teachings. The authenticity
of the Bible must be abandoned. It will be abandoned, and abandoned
soon. Its credibility, impaired by a knowledge of its lack of
authenticity and the exposure of its numberless errors, will be
contended for awhile longer. But this, in turn, will go. When its
credibility has been destroyed, and it is acknowledged to be mostly a
volume of fables and legends, priestcraft continuing to survive, the
clergy, as a <i lang="fr">dernier resort</i>, will descant upon the
divine lessons of morality taught by these fables and legends. But the
relentless iconoclasts of <span class="corr" id="xd26e13157" title=

<div class="divBody">
<p class="first">Arguments Against the Divine Origin and in Support of
the Human Origin of the Bible.</p>
<p>A celebrated theologian has used with much ingenuity and effect the
watch as an argument in support of the divine origin of the universe. I
have a watch. Like other watches it is not infallible. But supposing
that I should claim for it infallibility and divinity; that while other
watches are of human invention and workmanship, this particular make of
watches is the work of God. The claim would be deemed too absurd for
serious consideration. I would be regarded as a lunatic or a jester.
Now, it is no more absurd to claim infallibility and divinity for a
watch than it is to claim infallibility and divinity for a book. Yet
millions of people of recognized sanity and intelligence profess to
believe, and many of them do sincerely believe, that a book called the
Bible is divine. How do we account for this? It is simply the result of
centuries of religious education. I could have taken my children and
taught them that my watch is divine. Had I kept them isolated as far as
possible from other people, had I commanded them to shun discussion,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb434" href="#pb434" name=
"pb434">434</a>]</span>and forbidden them to reason about it, as the
clergy do in regard to the Bible, they would probably believe it. I was
taught that the Bible is divine. I believed it. But in a fortunate hour
I listened to the voice of Reason; I examined the claims of its
advocates; I read it; and the halo of holiness surrounding the old book
vanished.</p>
<p>As a supplement to my review of the Bible I shall present some
arguments, thirty-six in number, against the divine origin and in
support of the human origin of the Bible. The brevity and
incompleteness of many of them will, I admit, justify the conclusion
not proven. I have space for little more than a mere statement of them.
The evidence supporting them will be found in the preceding chapters of
this book.</p>
<p>In a discussion of this question the champion of the Bible is placed
at a tremendous disadvantage&mdash;is handicapped as it were&mdash;at
the very commencement by this fact: While both the advocates and
opponents of Bible divinity admit that man exists and has written
books, it has not been proven that a God even exists, much less that he
has written or inspired a book. But let us concede, for the sake of
argument, that there is a God; that he is all-powerful, all-wise, and
all-just; and that he can write or inspire a book. Is the Bible the
work of such a Being? It is not. The following are my arguments:
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb435" href="#pb435" name=
"pb435">435</a>]</span></p>
<p>1. <i>Its mechanical construction and appearance.</i> The Bible is
printed with type made by man, on paper made by man, and bound in a
volume by man. In its mechanical construction and appearance it does
not differ from other books.</p>
<p>2. <i>The character of its contents.</i> The contents of this book
consist of thoughts&mdash;human thoughts&mdash;every thought bearing
unmistakable evidence of having emanated from the human mind. There is
not a thought expressed in the Bible, the meaning of which can be
comprehended, that is beyond the power of man to conceive. If it
contains thoughts, the meaning of which cannot be comprehended, they
are not a revelation, and are self-evidently human.</p>
<p>3. <i>The manner in which its contents were communicated to man.</i>
These thoughts are expressed in human language. The Bible originally
appeared, it is claimed, in the Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek languages,
two of them obscure languages of Western Asia. The president of the
United States does not issue an important proclamation in the Cherokee
or Tagalese language, and the ruler of the universe would not have
issued a message intended for all mankind in the most obscure languages
of the world. Had he given a message to man he would have provided a
universal language for its transmission.</p>
<p>4. <i>Lack of divine supervision in its translation into other
tongues.</i> Failing to provide a universal language for its
transmission, God would at least have supervised its translation into
other languages. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb436" href="#pb436"
name="pb436">436</a>]</span>Only in this way could its inerrancy and
divinity have been preserved. Yet no divine supervision has been
exercised over the translators, the transcribers, and the printers of
this book. Divine supervision, it is admitted, was confined to the
original writers.</p>
<p>5. <i>Not given to man until at a late period in his existence.</i>
This is an argument advanced by Napoleon Bonaparte. Napoleon rejected
the Bible. He said that if it had been given to man at the creation he
might have accepted it, but that its late appearance proved to him that
it was of human origin.</p>
<p>6. <i>Not given as a guide to all mankind, but only to an
insignificant portion of it.</i> Not only has the Bible been confined
to a small period of man&rsquo;s existence, it is nearly all addressed
to one small race of earth&rsquo;s inhabitants. While Christians affirm
that it is a universal message intended for all, its doctrines and
ceremonies pertain to the Jews. This is wholly true of the Old
Testament, and, with the exception of a few doubtful passages, true of
the Four Gospels, the chief books of the New Testament. Now, is it
reasonable to suppose that this great and just All-Father, as he is
called, would for centuries take into his special confidence and care a
few of his children and ignore and neglect the others?</p>
<p>7. <i>It deals for the most part, not with the works of God, but
with the works of man.</i> What man does and knows is not a divine
revelation. Paine says: &ldquo;Revelation, therefore, cannot be
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb437" href="#pb437" name=
"pb437">437</a>]</span>applied to anything done upon earth, of which
man himself is the actor or witness; and consequently all the
historical and anecdotal part of the Bible, which is almost the whole
of it, is not within the meaning and compass of the word revelation,
and therefore is not the word of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>8. <i>But one of many Bibles.</i> There are many Bibles. The world
is divided into various religious systems. The adherents of each system
have their sacred book, or Bible. Brahmins have the Vedas and Puranas,
Buddhists the Tripitaka, Zoroastrians the Zend Avesta, Confucians the
five King, Mohammedans the Koran, and Christians the Holy Bible. The
adherents of each claim that their book is a revelation from
God&mdash;that the others are spurious. Now, if the Christian Bible
were a revelation&mdash;if it were God&rsquo;s only revelation, as
affirmed&mdash;would he allow these spurious books to be imposed upon
mankind and delude the greater portion of his children?</p>
<p>9. <i>Many versions of this Bible.</i> Not only are there many
Bibles in the world, there are many versions of the Christian Bible.
The believers in a divine revelation have not been agreed as to what
books belong to this revelation. The ancient Jews, who are said to have
sustained more intimate relations with God than any other race, were
not agreed in regard to this. The accepted Hebrew version contains 39
books (22 as divided by the Jews), the Samaritan version <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb438" href="#pb438" name=
"pb438">438</a>]</span>contains but 6 books (some copies 5); while the
Septuagint version contains 50. The early Christians were not agreed.
The Syriac version of the New Testament contains 22 books; the Italic
24 (some copies 25); the Egyptian 26; the Vulgate 27. The Sinaitic and
Alexandrian MSS. each contains 29 books, but they are not all the same.
The Gothic version omitted four books in the Old Testament. The
Ethiopic omitted books in both the Old and New Testaments which are now
accepted, and included books in both which are now rejected. The Bibles
of the Roman Catholic, of the Greek Catholic, and of the Protestant
churches do not contain the same books. This disagreement regarding the
books of the Bible is proof of their human origin.</p>
<p>10. <i>Incompetency of those who determined the canon.</i> If the
Bible were the word of God it would not have required the deliberations
of a church council to determine the fact. And yet the Christian canon
was determined in this manner; and it took centuries of time and many
councils to make a collection of books that was acceptable to the
church. Not until the close of the fourth century were all the books of
the Bible adopted.</p>
<p>It is commonly supposed that the members of these councils were men
of great learning and still greater honesty. On the contrary, they were
mostly men of little learning and less honesty. They were ignorant,
fanatical, and immoral. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb439" href=
"#pb439" name="pb439">439</a>]</span>Their deliberations were
characterized by trickery, lying, mob violence, and even murder. Many
of them, so far from being able to read and critically examine the
books of the Bible, could not read their own names. Even the molders of
their opinions concerning the canon&mdash;Iren&aelig;us, Tertullian,
Clement of Alexandria, Jerome, and Augustine&mdash;were they living
now, would be considered very ordinary clay. The historical facts in
regard to the formation of the Bible, if generally known, would be
sufficient to dispel all illusions respecting its divinity.</p>
<p>11. <i>Books belonging to this so-called revelation lost or
destroyed.</i> There were many other Jewish and Christian writings for
which divinity was claimed and which Bible writers themselves declare
to be of as much importance and authority as those which still exist.
The transitory and perishable nature of these books proves their human
origin, and shows that while those that remain are more enduring they
are not immortal and imperishable, and hence not divine.</p>
<p>12. <i>Different versions of the same book do not agree.</i> There
are a hundred versions and translations of the books of the Bible. No
two versions of any book agree. The translators and copyists have
altered nearly every paragraph. The earlier versions alone contain more
than 100,000 different readings. The original text no longer exists and
cannot be restored. Every <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb440" href=
"#pb440" name="pb440">440</a>]</span>version, it is admitted, abounds
with corruptions. Now, to assert that a book is at the same time divine
and corrupt is a contradiction of terms. God, it is affirmed, is
all-wise, all-powerful, and all-just. If he is all-wise he knew when
his work was being corrupted; if he is all-powerful he could have
prevented it; if he is all-just he would have prevented it. This God,
it is declared, is everywhere and sees everything. He watches the
sparrows when they fall, and numbers the hairs of our heads. He knows
the secrets of every heart. If he made a revelation to his children,
upon the acceptance and observance of which depends their eternal
happiness, and then knowingly and wilfully allowed this revelation to
be perverted and misunderstood, he is not a just God, but an unjust
devil.</p>
<p>13. <i>The mutability of its contents.</i> The alterations made by
transcribers and translators demonstrate the mutability of its
contents, and this disproves its divine character. To admit that man
can alter the work of God is to admit that human power transcends
divine power. If the thoughts composing the Bible were divine man could
not alter them.</p>
<p>14. <i>The anonymous character of its books.</i> If the Bible is to
be accepted even as a reliable human record its authors ought, at
least, to be persons of acknowledged intelligence and veracity. And yet
almost nothing is known of its authors. The authorship of fully fifty
books of the Bible <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb441" href="#pb441"
name="pb441">441</a>]</span>is absolutely unknown. Its books are nearly
all either anonymous or self-evident forgeries. This is true of the
most important books. The Pentateuch we know was not written by Moses,
nor the Four Gospels by Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. Aside from the
anonymous character of the writings of the Bible, with a few
exceptions, they evince neither a superior degree of intelligence nor a
high regard for the truth.</p>
<p>15. <i>Its numerous contradictions.</i> If the Bible were divine
there would be perfect harmony in all its statements. One contradiction
is fatal to the claim of inerrancy and divinity. Now the Bible contains
not merely one, but hundreds of contradictions. Nearly every book
contains statements that are contradicted by the writers of other
books. This is especially true of the Four Gospels. The writers of
these agree that a being called Jesus Christ lived and died; but
regarding nearly every event connected with his life and death they
disagree. Human discord, and not divine harmony, dwells in its
pages.</p>
<p>16. <i>Its historical errors.</i> If the Bible were divine its
history would be infallible. But it is not. It presents as historical
facts the most palpable fictions, and denies or misstates the best
authenticated truths of history. Referring to Bible writers, the
eminent Dutch divines, Drs. Kuenen, Oort, and Hooykaas, in their
preface to &ldquo;The Bible for Learners,&rdquo; say: &ldquo;As a rule,
they concern themselves very little with the question whether what they
narrated really <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb442" href="#pb442"
name="pb442">442</a>]</span>happened so or not.&rdquo; Its history is
fallible and human.</p>
<p>17. <i>Its scientific errors.</i> God, the alleged author of this
book, it is claimed, created the universe. He ought, then, to be
familiar with his own works. The writers of the Bible, on the contrary,
display a lamentable ignorance of the universe and its phenomena. The
Rev. Dr. Lindsay Alexander, orthodox Calvinist, in his &ldquo;Biblical
Theology,&rdquo; referring to these writers, says: &ldquo;We find in
their writings statements which no ingenuity can reconcile with what
modern research has shown to be scientific truth.&rdquo; The
demonstrated truths of modern science were unknown to them. They give
us the crude ideas of primitive man and not the infallible knowledge of
an omniscient God.</p>
<p>18. <i>Its alleged miracles.</i> The Bible is filled with marvelous
stories. The sun and moon stand still; the globe is submerged with
water to the depth of several miles; rods are transformed into
serpents, dust into lice, and water into blood and wine; animals hold
converse with man in his own language; men pass through fiery furnaces
unharmed; a child is born without a natural father; the dead arise from
the grave and walk the earth again. These marvelous stories&mdash;these
miracles&mdash;are adduced to prove the divine origin of the Bible.
They prove its human origin. If these miracles prove the divinity of
the Bible, then nearly all the books of old are divine, for they abound
with <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb443" href="#pb443" name=
"pb443">443</a>]</span>these same miracles. If these stories be true,
if these miracles occurred, the laws of nature were arrested and
suspended. The laws of nature are immutable. If the laws of nature are
immutable they cannot be suspended. The laws of nature cannot be
suspended; they never have been suspended; these stories are false; and
being false, the Bible is not divine.</p>
<p>19. <i>Its immoral teachings.</i> If the Bible were of divine origin
its moral teachings would be divine. It would be what its adherents
affirm it to be, an infallible moral guide. But its moral teachings are
not divine; it is not an infallible moral guide. It contains, like
other Bibles, some moral precepts; but it also sanctions nearly every
crime and vice. War and murder, bigotry and persecution, tyranny and
slavery, demonism and witchcraft, adultery and prostitution,
drunkenness and vagrancy, robbery and cheating, falsehood and
deception, are all authorized and commended by this book. It cannot,
therefore, be divine.</p>
<p>20. <i>Its inferior literary character.</i> If the Bible were the
word of God, as a literary composition it would be above criticism. It
would be as far superior to all other books as God is superior to man.
Its rhetoric would transcend in beauty the glorious coloring of a
Titian. Its logic would be faultless. The Bible is not such a book. It
contains some admirable pieces and these owe much of their literary
merit to the translators, appearing as our version did in the
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb444" href="#pb444" name=
"pb444">444</a>]</span>golden age of English literature. As a whole it
is far inferior to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome; inferior
to the literature of modern Italy, of France, of Germany, and of
England. If the Bible be the word of God it is a long way from God up
to <span class="corr" id="xd26e13300" title=
"Source: Shakspeare">Shakespeare</span>.</p>
<p>21. <i>Its writers do not claim to be inspired.</i> Had the writers
of the Bible been inspired they would have known it and would have
proclaimed it. Had they claimed to be inspired it would not prove the
Bible to be divine, for like Mohammed, they might have been deluded,
or, like a more recent finder of a holy book, impostors. But they do
not even claim that their books are divine revelations. Some of these
books contain what purport to be divine revelations, but the books
themselves do not pretend to be divine. The only exception is the book
called Revelation, admittedly the most doubtful book of the Bible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All scripture is given by inspiration.&rdquo; Waiving the
questions of authenticity and correct translation, who wrote this?
Paul. What was the scripture when he wrote? The Old Testament, the Old
Testament alone. The writers of the Old Testament do not claim to be
divinely inspired. This is a claim made by the later Jews and by the
early Christians. Paul and the other writers of the New Testament do
not claim that their writings are divine. This, too, is a claim made by
others long after they were written. <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb445" href="#pb445" name="pb445">445</a>]</span></p>
<p>The fact that the writers of the Bible do not believe and do not
assert that their books are of divine origin, that this claim was first
made many years after they were composed, by those who knew nothing of
their origin, is of itself, in the absence of all other evidence,
sufficient to demonstrate their human origin.</p>
<p>22. <i>God has never declared it to be his word.</i> The Bible does
not, as we have seen, purport to be the word of God. Nowhere, neither
in the book nor outside of it, has he declared it to be his revealed
will. It contains various messages, chiefly of local concern, which he
is said to have delivered to man; but the book, as such, is not
ascribed to him nor claimed by him.</p>
<p>23. <i>Whatever its origin it cannot be a divine revelation to
us.</i> Even supposing that the writers of the Bible had claimed to be
inspired and that these books really were a divine revelation to them,
they would not, as Paine justly argues, be a divine revelation to us.
The only evidence we would have of their divinity would be the claim of
the writer&mdash;a claim that any writer might make&mdash;a claim that
even an honest writer might make were he, like many religious writers,
the victim of a delusion.</p>
<p>24. <i>A written revelation unnecessary.</i> To affirm the necessity
of a written revelation from God to man, as Christians do, is to deny
his divine attributes and ascribe to him the limitations of man. If God
be omnipotent and omnipresent a written revelation is unnecessary.
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb446" href="#pb446" name=
"pb446">446</a>]</span>To impute to him an unnecessary act is to impute
to him an imperfection, and to impute to him an imperfection is to
impugn his divinity. We do not write a communication to one who is
present. Think of an infinite, all-powerful, and ever-present God
communing with his living children through an obscure and corrupted
message said to have been delivered to a tribe of barbarians three
thousand years ago!</p>
<p>25. <i>Its want of universal acceptance.</i> A divine revelation
intended for all mankind can be harmonized only with a universal
acceptance of this revelation. God, it is affirmed, has made a
revelation to the world. Those who receive and accept this revelation
are saved; those who fail to receive and accept it are lost. This God,
it is claimed, is all-powerful and all-just. If he is all-powerful he
can give his children a revelation. If he is all-just he will give this
revelation to all. He will not give it to a part of them and allow them
to be saved and withhold it from the others and suffer them to be lost.
Your house is on fire. Your children are asleep in their rooms. What is
your duty? To arouse them and rescue them&mdash;to awaken all of them
and save all of them. If you awaken and save only a part of them when
it is in your power to save them all you are a fiend. If you stand
outside and blow a trumpet and say, &ldquo;I have warned them, I have
done my duty,&rdquo; and they perish, you are still a fiend. If God
does not give his revelation to all; if he <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb447" href="#pb447" name="pb447">447</a>]</span>does
not disclose its divinity to all; if he does not make it comprehensible
and acceptable to all; in short, if he does not save all, he is the
prince of fiends.</p>
<p>If all the world&rsquo;s inhabitants but one accepted the Bible and
there was one who could not honestly accept it, its rejection by one
human being would prove that it is not from an all-powerful and an
all-just God; for an all-powerful God who failed to reach and convince
even one of his children would not be an all-just God. Has the Bible
been given to all the world? Do all accept it? Three-fourths of the
human race reject it; millions have never heard of it.</p>
<p>26. <i>Non-agreement of those who profess to accept it.</i> If the
Bible were the work of God there would be no disagreement in regard to
its teachings. Its every word would be as clear as the light of day.
Yet those who profess to accept it as divine are not agreed as to what
it means. In the Christian world are a hundred sects, each with a
different interpretation of its various teachings. Take the rite of
baptism. Baptism is enjoined by the Bible. But what is baptism? The
three leading Protestant denominations of this country are the Baptist,
the Presbyterian, and the Methodist. I ask the Baptist what constitutes
baptism, and he tells me immersion; I ask the Presbyterian, and he
tells me sprinkling; I ask the Methodist which is proper, and he tells
me to take my choice. Sectarianism is conclusive proof that the Bible
is human. <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb448" href="#pb448" name=
"pb448">448</a>]</span></p>
<p>27. <i>Inability of those who affirm both a human and a divine
element in it to distinguish the one from the other.</i> Confronted by
its many glaring errors and abominable teachings, some contend that a
part of it is the work of man and a part the work of God. And yet they
are unable to separate the one from the other. If a hundred attempts
were made by them to eliminate the human from the divine no two results
would be the same. Their inability to distinguish this supposed divine
element from the human is proof that both have the same
origin&mdash;that both are human.</p>
<p>28. <i>The character of its reputed divine author.</i> The Bible is
an atrocious libel on God. It traduces his character, and denies his
divinity. The God of the Bible is not this all-powerful, all-wise, and
all-just Ruler of the universe, but a creature of the human
imagination, limited in power and knowledge, and infinite only in
vanity and cruelty.</p>
<p>29. <i>The belief of primitive Christians in its divinity not an
immediate conviction but a growth.</i> Had the books of the Bible been
divinely inspired their divinity would have been recognized at once.
When they originally appeared they were believed and known to be the
works of man and accepted as such.</p>
<p>Referring to the Old Testament, Dr. Davidson says: &ldquo;The degree
of authority attaching to the Biblical books grew from less to greater,
till it culminated in a divine character, a sacredness <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb449" href="#pb449" name=
"pb449">449</a>]</span>rising even to infallibility&rdquo; (The Canon
of the Bible, p. 274).</p>
<p>Of the New Testament Dr. Westcott says: &ldquo;It cannot, however,
be denied that the idea of the inspiration of the New Testament, in the
sense in which it is maintained now, was the growth of time&rdquo; (On
the Canon of the New Testament, p. 55).</p>
<p>The admitted fact that these books were originally presented and
received as human productions, and that the idea of inspiration and
divinity was gradually and slowly developed by the priesthood, is
conclusive proof that they are of human and not of divine origin.</p>
<p>30. <i>Its acceptance by modern Christians the result of religious
teaching.</i> In India the people believe that the Vedas and other
sacred books or Bibles are divine. Why do they believe it? Because for
a hundred generations they have been taught it by their priests. The
Turks believe that the Koran came from God. They believe it because for
twelve centuries this has been their religious teaching. For nearly two
thousand years Christian priests have taught that the Holy Bible is the
word of God. As a result of this the masses of Europe and America
believe it to be divine. Each generation, thoroughly impregnated with
superstition, transmitted the disease to the succeeding one and made it
easy for the clergy to impose their teachings on the people and
perpetuate their rule. The belief of Christians in the divinity
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb450" href="#pb450" name=
"pb450">450</a>]</span>of the Bible, like the belief of Hindoos in the
divinity of the Vedas, and of Mohammedans in the divinity of the Koran,
is the result of religious teaching.</p>
<p>The ease with which a belief in the divine character of a book
obtains, even in an enlightened age, is illustrated by the inspired (?)
books that have appeared in this country from time to time, and for
several of which numerous adherents have been secured. About
seventy-five years ago a curious volume, called the Book of Mormon,
made its appearance. A few impostors and deluded men proclaimed its
divinity. A priesthood was established; Mormon education and Mormon
proselytism began their work, and already nearly a million converts
have been made to the divinity of this book.</p>
<p>Dr. Isaac Watts says: &ldquo;The greatest part of the Christian
world can hardly give any reason why they believe the Bible to be the
Word of God, but because they have always believed it, and they were
taught so from their infancy.&rdquo; Really the entire Christian
world&mdash;pope, bishop, priest, and layman&mdash;the learned and the
unlearned&mdash;can give no other valid reason.</p>
<p>Profoundly true are these words of the historian Lecky: &ldquo;The
overwhelming majority of the human race necessarily accept their
opinions from authority. Whether they do so avowedly, like the
Catholics, or unconsciously, like most Protestants, is immaterial. They
have <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb451" href="#pb451" name=
"pb451">451</a>]</span>neither time nor opportunity to examine for
themselves. They are taught certain doctrines on disputed questions as
if they were unquestionable truths, when they are incapable of judging,
and every influence is employed to deepen the impression. This is the
origin of their belief. Not until long years of mental conflict have
passed can they obtain the inestimable boon of an assured and
untrammeled mind. The fable of the ancient is still true. The woman
even now sits at the portal of life, presenting a cup to all who enter
in which diffuses through every vein a poison that will cling to them
for ever. The judgment may pierce the clouds of prejudice; in the
moments of her strength she may even rejoice and triumph in her
liberty; yet the conceptions of childhood will long remain latent in
the mind to reappear in every hour of weakness, when the tension of the
reason is relaxed, and when the power of old associations is
supreme&rdquo; (History of Rationalism, Vol. II., pp. 95, 96).</p>
<p>Schopenhauer says: &ldquo;There is in childhood a period measured by
six, or at most by ten years, when any well inculcated dogma, no matter
how extravagantly absurd, is sure to retain its hold for life.&rdquo;
Considering the impressionable character of the immature mind, and how
nearly impossible it is to eradicate the impressions of childhood, the
wonder is not that so many believe in the divinity of the Bible,
<span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb452" href="#pb452" name=
"pb452">452</a>]</span>unreasonable as the belief is, but rather that
so many disbelieve it.</p>
<p>31. <i>An article of merchandise.</i> Bibles are manufactured and
sold just as other books are manufactured and sold. Some are printed on
poor paper, cheaply bound, and sold at a low price; while others are
printed on the best of paper, richly bound, and sold at a high price.
But all are sold at a profit. The publisher and the book seller, or
Bible agent, derive pecuniary gain from their publication and sale. It
may be urged that the Bible can be obtained for the asking, that
millions of copies are gratuitously distributed. But this is done in
the interest of Christian propagandism. Nearly all religious,
political, and social organizations, to promote their work, make a free
distribution of their literature.</p>
<p>The printing and selling of Bibles is as much a part of the
publishing business as the printing and selling of novels. One of the
leading publishing houses of this country is that of the American Bible
Society. Wealthy and deluded Christians have been successfully
importuned to contribute millions to this Society. Directly or
indirectly the clergy reap the harvest, leaving the gleanings to the
lay employees, many of whom labor at starvation wages. In Great Britain
the crown has claimed the sole and perpetual right to print the Bible
(A. V.). For monetary or other considerations her kings <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb453" href="#pb453" name="pb453">453</a>]</span>have
delegated this right to publishers who have amassed fortunes from its
sale. Twenty years ago Bible publishing was characterized as the worst
monopoly in England. If the Bible were divine God would not allow it to
be used as merchandise. It would be as free as light and air.</p>
<p>32. <i>A pillar of priestcraft.</i> Not only is the Bible printed
and sold like other books, but its so-called divine teachings
themselves are used as merchandise. There are in Christendom half a
million priests and preachers. These priests and preachers are
supported by the people. Even the humble laborer and the poor servant
girl are obliged to contribute a portion of their hard earnings for
this purpose. In this country alone two thousand million dollars are
invested for their benefit; while two hundred million dollars are
annually expended for their support. For what are these men employed?
To interpret God&rsquo;s revelation to mankind, we are told. An
all-powerful God needing an interpreter! According to the clergy, God
though omnipresent has had to send a communication to his children, and
though omnipotent he cannot make them understand it. Those ignorant of
other tongues and unable to make known their wants require
interpreters. The various Indian tribes employ them. For the sake of
gain these men degrade their God to the level of an American savage,
representing him as incapable of <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb454"
href="#pb454" name="pb454">454</a>]</span>expressing his thoughts to
man, and representing themselves as the possessors of both human and
divine wisdom and authorized to speak for him.</p>
<p>These Bibles are simply the agents employed by priests to establish
and perpetuate their power. They claim to be God&rsquo;s vicegerents on
earth. As their credentials they present these old religious and
mythological books. These books abound with the marvelous and
mysterious&mdash;the impossible and unreasonable&mdash;and are easily
imposed upon the credulous. If the contents of a book be intelligible
and reasonable you can not convince these people that it is other than
natural and human; but if its contents be unintelligible and
unreasonable it is easy to convince them that it is supernatural and
divine. Smith&rsquo;s Bible Dictionary says: &ldquo;The language of the
Apostles is intentionally obscure.&rdquo; Of course; if it were not
obscure there would be no need of priests to interpret it, and what is
Scripture for if not to give employment to the priests?</p>
<p>We are triumphantly told that the Bible has withstood the assaults
of critics for two thousand years. But as much can be said of other
sacred books. Any business will thrive as long as it is profitable.
Bibles will be printed as long as there is a demand for them; and there
will be a demand for them as long as priests do a lucrative business
with them. Considering their abilities the <span class="corr" id=
"xd26e13409" title="Source: venders">vendors</span> of the Gospel are
among the <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb455" href="#pb455" name=
"pb455">455</a>]</span>best paid men in the world to-day. The wealth of
men and the smiles of women are bestowed upon them more lavishly than
upon any other class. There are thousands in the ministry enjoying
comfortable and even luxurious livings who would eke out a miserable
subsistence in any other vocation.</p>
<p>33. <i>Its advocates demand its acceptance by faith rather than by
reason.</i> In the Gospels and in the Pauline Epistles, the principal
books of the New Testament, Christ, the reputed founder, and Paul, the
real founder of the Christian religion, both place religious faith,
<i>i. e.</i>, blind credulity, above reason. This evinces a lack of
divine strength and is a confession of human weakness.</p>
<p>Modern advocates of the Bible in presenting the dogma of divine
inspiration ask us to discard reason and accept it by faith. In the
affected opinion of these men, to examine this question is dangerous,
to criticise the Bible is impious, and to deny or even doubt its
divinity is a crime. What is this but a tacit acknowledgment that the
faith they wish us to exercise is wanting in themselves? This
condemnation of reason and commendation of credulity is an insult to
human intelligence. A dogma which reason is obliged to reject, and
which faith alone can accept, is self-evidently false; and its
retention is not for the purpose of supporting a divine <span class=
"pagenum">[<a id="pb456" href="#pb456" name=
"pb456">456</a>]</span>truth, but for the purpose of supporting a human
lie.</p>
<p>34. <i>The refusal of its advocates to correct its acknowledged
errors.</i> That the clergy are controlled by mercenary motives rather
than a love of truth is attested by the fact that they continue to
teach the admitted errors of the Bible. Our Authorized version, it is
conceded by Christian scholars, contains hundreds of errors. That the
Revisers corrected many of these errors is admitted. Yet the clergy
cling to these errors and refuse to accept a corrected text. The
principal reasons assigned for retaining the Old version instead of
adopting the New are these: 1. The English of three hundred years ago
possesses a certain charm which distinguishes the Bible from more
modern works and secures for it a greater reverence. 2. Its division
into chapters and verses renders it more convenient. 3. The adoption of
the New would expose the errors of the Old, suggest the possible
fallibility of the New, and sow the seeds of doubt. Thus expediency
prompts them to teach the acknowledged errors of man in preference to
what they claim to be the truths of God. This proves the human
character of the Bible and the insincerity of its professed
exponents.</p>
<p>35. <i>Its authority maintained by fraud and force.</i> For sixteen
hundred years&mdash;from the time that Constantine, to gain a political
advantage over his rivals, became a convert to the Christian
faith&mdash;corruption and coercion have been the predominant

sword, and gun, and gibbet, and rack and thumbscrew, and every artifice
that cunning and falsehood could devise, have been used to uphold the
dogma of this book&rsquo;s divinity. To-day, in nearly every nation of
Europe, the powers of the state are employed to compel allegiance to
it. And in this free Republic, everywhere, with bribe and threat, the
authorities are invoked to force its bloody and filthy pages into the
hands of innocent school girls to pollute with superstition, lust, and
cruelty their young and tender minds. These deeds of violence, these
pious frauds, these appeals to the civil powers, all prove it to be the
work of man and not the word of God.</p>
<p>36. <i>The intelligence of the world for the most part rejects
it.</i> If the Bible were divine the wise would be the best qualified
to realize and appreciate the fact; for while all may err the judgment
of the intelligent is better than the judgment of the ignorant. In
Christendom the ignorant nearly all believe the Bible to be the
infallible word of God, every verse of which is to be accepted
literally. A more intelligent class reject the objectionable portions
of it, or give to them a more rational and humane interpretation. Those
of the highest intelligence&mdash;the great leaders of the world in
national affairs, in the domain of literature, in science and
philosophy, and in Biblical and religious criticism&mdash;the
Washingtons and Lincolns, the Franklins <span class="pagenum">[<a id=
"pb458" href="#pb458" name="pb458">458</a>]</span>and Jeffersons, the
Fredericks and Napoleons, the Gambettas and Garibaldis; the
<span class="corr" id="xd26e13446" title=

Schillers, the Carlyles and Emersons, the Eliots and <span class="corr"
id="xd26e13449" title="Source: DeStaels">de Sta&euml;ls</span>; the
Humboldts and Darwins, the Huxleys and Haeckels, the Drapers and
Tyndalls, the Comtes and Spencers; the Humes and Gibbons, the Voltaires
and Renans, the Bauers and Strausses, the Paines and
Ingersolls&mdash;all these reject its divinity. A Gladstone is an
anomaly.</p>
<p>Dr. Watson of Scotland gives frank expression to a fact of which his
fellow clergymen are fully cognizant, but which they are loth to admit.
He says: &ldquo;The great, and the wise, and the mighty, are not with
us. These men, the master minds, the imperial leaders among men are
outside our most Christian church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ignorant suppose that the intelligent accept the Bible; because
the intelligent, dependent in a large degree upon the ignorant, and
knowing that of all passions religious prejudice and hatred are the
worst, do not care to arouse their antagonism by an unnecessary avowal
of their disbelief. This is especially true of men in public life. But
these men think; and to their intellectual friends they talk.</p>
<p>In his &ldquo;History of the Bible,&rdquo; Bronson C. Keeler says:
&ldquo;The only men distinguished for their learning who now believe it
to be the inspired word of God, are the men who are, either directly or
indirectly, making their living out of it.&rdquo; Do these learned
divines themselves believe <span class="pagenum">[<a id="pb459" href=
"#pb459" name="pb459">459</a>]</span>it? Nearly every intelligent
clergyman entertains and confidentially expresses opinions regarding
the Bible which he dare not proclaim from the pulpit. But master and
slave are alike growing weary&mdash;the master of his duplicity, the
slave of his burden. Emancipation for both is approaching. To-day the
clergy smile when they meet; some day they will laugh outright, this
stupendous farce will be ended, and man will be free. <span class=
